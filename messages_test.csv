call for papers : dgfs meeting 1998,"call for papers as part of the annual meeting of the german linguistic society ( deutsche gesellschaft fuer sprachwissenschaft ) , to be held in halle ( saale ) , germany , march 4 / 6 1988 , there will be a workshop ( arbeitsgruppe ) on the following topic : the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication in the last thirty years research on intercultural communication has attracted increasing scientific attention not only as a result of social developments but also due to the growing interdisciplinary cooperation between different disciplines such as cultural anthropology , ethnology , sociology , and linguistics ( c . f . ehlich 1996 ) . a central topic of the linguistic analysis of intercultural communication is determined by the experience that the use of a common language system does not guarantee mutual understanding . therefore , the theoretical conception of intercultural communication ( either in everyday or in institutional situations ) is characterized by misunderstandings ( gumperz ) . analyses of the mediation of intercultural competences show that both contrastive and interactive investigations into intercultural communication are important in order to answer the questions on the contextualizations of speech actions and on their universal or culture specific characteristics . only recently , has the innovative potential of intercultural communication started to attract particular attention ( c . f . koole & ten thije 1994 ) . it has become clear that research into intercultural communication should take an interdisciplinary perspective and requires reflection on traditional linguistic categories of linguistic description in order to see which new discursive forms are facilitated by intercultural communication . the specific question to be adressed in this workshop is whether the linguistic involvement in intercultural research has resulted in the extension and enhancement of new linguistic categories and research methods . reflexion on this issue should focus on topics like procedures of assertaining understanding ( verstdndnissicherung ) ( c . f . metacommunication ) , pragmatic universals ( c . f . politeness ) , contrastive analyses of speech actions and texts , linguistic forms of perspectivity or culture comparison . references ehlich , k .

muc - 7 call for participation,"* * * call for participation * * * seventh message understanding system evaluation and message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) evaluation : 2 - 6 march 1998 conference : april 1998 washington , d . c . area sponsored by : the human language systems tipster text program of the defense advanced research projects agency information technology office ( darpa / ito ) the message understanding conferences have provided on ongoing forum for assessing the state of the art and practice in text analysis technology and for exchanging information on innovative computational techniques in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks . the evaluations have provided researchers and potential sponsors and customers with a quantitative means to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies , and the results reported on at the conferences have sparked customer interest in the potential utility of the technologies . the seventh message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) will provide an opportunity for both new and experienced muc participants to participate in a flexible evaluation , suited to development needs and abilities . it will provide : * opportunity to select among a variety of tasks : named entity ( ne ) , coreference ( co ) , template element ( te ) , template relationship ( tr ) and scenario template ( st ) . * two tasks for evaluating component technologies ( ne and co ) , which use standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) as output format * redesigned information extraction ( ie ) task , with two domain-independent subtasks ( te and tr ) separated from domain-dependent subtask ( st ) . * emphases of st task on portability and on minimizing human resources required to participate in the evaluation . * three experimental tracks to explore new data sets and tasks . participation in muc - 7 is actively sought from both new and veteran organizations . with the new and redesigned evaluation tasks , muc - 7 offers a good opportunity for organizations to try out new ideas for handling nlp problems that are of both scientific and practical interest without having to participate in the entire range of tasks . the conference itself will consist primarily of presentations and discussions of innovative techniques , system design , and test results . there will also be an opportunity for participants to demo their evaluation systems . attendance at the conference is limited to evaluation participants and to guests invited by the darpa tipster text program . a conference proceedings , including test results , will be published . schedule : 1 july 97 : application deadline for participation 15 july 97 : release of ne , co , te , tr , and example st training data and scorer 8 september 97 : release of dry run st task definition , training data , and scorer 29 sept - 3 oct 97 : muc - 7 dry run ( all participants ) 6 february 98 : release of formal test st task definition , training data , and scorer 2 - 6 march 98 : muc - 7 formal run 7 - 9 april 98 : 7th message understanding conference ( tentative dates ) data and task description : the texts to be used for system development and testing are news service articles from the new york times news service , supplied by the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) [ ldc @ ldc . upenn . edu ] . training , dry run , and test data for all the tasks are extracted from a corpus of approximately 158 , 000 articles . sets of articles to be used in the muc - 7 evaluation will be distributed via ftp upon payment of a one time fee of $ 100 and upon signing of a user agreement for the use of these texts . the user agreement can be retrieved from the ldc catalog ( evaluation agreements ) . the url for the ldc home page is : http : / / www . ldc . upenn . edu . five separate evaluations will be conducted as part of muc - 7 . the definition of these evaluations has been worked out since late 1996 by members of the muc - 7 planning committee . the evaluations may be viewed as capturing the results of text analysis at various levels of aggregation of information : * named entity ( ne ) requires only that the system under evaluation identify each bit of pertinent information in isolation from all others . * coreference ( co ) requires connecting all references to "" identical "" entities . * template element ( te ) requires grouping entity attributes together into entity "" objects .

semantics,"yeom , jae - il ; a presuppositional analysis of specific indefinites : common grounds as structured information states ; 0-8153 - 3175 - 4 , cloth ; pages , $ 65 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics a specific indefinite presupposes that someone has in mind an individual who has the property denoted by its descriptive content . having an individual in mind means that the agent knows who the referent is , and thus it affects the information state of the agent , but not the others . the asymmetric information , shared by all participants in a conversation , cannot be represented when the common ground has only one information state . thus a common ground must have multiple information states , each for each participant in a conversation . the information state of the agent who has an individual in mind must be differentiated from the others ' by being structured into sub-information - states so that each sub-information - state associates the specific indefinite with a different unique individual . it then conveys the information that the agent has some individual in mind , but that it is not known yet who it is . this analysis thus requires a new dynamic semantics which is partially representational and partially denotational . this leads to a new analysis of proper names . specific indefinites tend to have widest scope , which is explained by claiming that specific indefinites trigger presuppositions . presuppositions are assumed to have various scopes with respect to operators in a sentence , and the strongest reading is preferred on rational and economic basis . it is shown that stronger readings roughly correspond to wider scopes . this book will be of interest to scholars who work on indefinite nps , presuppositions , anaphora in belief contexts , and dynamic semantics in general . e - mail : info @ garland . com

wolfram and schilling - estes : american english,"wolfram , walt and schilling - estes , natalie . ( 1998 ) . american english . oxford , u . k . : blackwell . isbn 0-631 - 20846 - 5 ( hardcover ) . rrp : us $ 59 . 95 ( hardcover ) 16 . 99 / us $ 29 . 95 the rich phonology of american "" accents "" is appreciated and instantly identifiable by non - american speakers of english worldwide , through television , radio and now ( perhaps ) through the internet . however , the perceived homogeneity of the american way of speaking as something uniquely "" american "" by these speakers of english , lies in stark contrast to the diversity of american english which is the domestic reality . in this exciting revision of wolfram 's classic "" dialects and american english "" , wolfram and schilling - estes not only attempt to provide a detailed account of the geographical and sociocultural distribution of certain kinds of american english , through distinct dialects , grammar , and usage , but also attempt to dispel a number of urban ( and not-so - urban ) myths common among native american english speakers . the book begins by contrasting the popular definition of "" dialects "" and their relative social desirability ( or otherwise ) , as perceived by native speakers who often feel they do not speak a dialect , with technical definitions from linguistics in the context of the so-called "" desirability-deficit "" debate . the work of schilling - estes in documenting the ocracoke english of north carolina , in particular , places her in a unique position to comment on language variation and the social issues involved in linguistic minorities ( especially in attempting to dispel myths regarding social desirability and dialects ) . the second chapter contrasts linguistic and sociohistorical explanations of the processes by which different dialects arise in languages , and more generally , why languages change over time . whilst the latter explanation sees languages and dialects as arising from the interaction of social and historical conditions , such as migration , settlement , and language contact , the former view sees languages as dynamical systems which have an inherent capacity and impetus to change , which arises from their structure . although some linguists are not directly concerned with sociohistorical factors in language change , the authors successfully integrate both viewpoints by examining general processes such as grammaticalization in the context of specific examples ( such as the new york city vernacular ) . however , those interested solely in a comprehensive review of distinctive american grammar , independent of social factors , should look elsewhere - this book is not a taxonomic ( and nor should it be ) . however , the third chapter which discusses levels of dialect should be useful for understanding the strata of dialects in contemporary american speech . the fourth chapter provides a historical overview of the development of american dialects , from elizabethan influences and pre-revolutionary dialects , to the rise of the west coast and twentieth century accents . this chapter successfully uses geographical diagrams and maps not only to demonstrate localised changes in distinctive dialect features ( such as r-lessness and r-fulness ) that have occurred throughout the history of the united states , but also to demonstrate the flow and influence of dialects during settlement of the interior , and how these changes are related to issues such as language contact and language borrowing from native americans . chapter 5 continues this process by developing examples of regional dialects and variations from many areas of the united states . chapters 6 and 7 develop the idea of dialects beyond regional and geographical differences to encompass dialect change and differences based on social class , ethnicity and gender . these chapters consider key issues such as the patterning of social difference in language in the context of specific examples , such as african american vernacular english ( aave ) . it is interesting to note in this example that even though at least eight distinctive grammatical features distinguish aave from the anglo american dialect , there is variation within each group sufficient to make comparisons difficult for linguists . a more general case is examined with respect to interactions of three or more languages , as is the case in robeson county nc , where native americans constitute 40 % of the county population , where their accent is clearly dominant . chapters 8 and 9 moves away from group analysis of dialects and language to questions of individual language use and style , and the social distribution of these usages . theories of style shifting , such as the attention to speech model , speech accommodation theory and the audience design model are reviewed , and research methods for understanding individual speech acts within paradigms that focus on group-based methods are discussed ( including corpus methods ) . group - exclusive dialect features and dialect patterning are discussed in the context of research methods such as implicational arrays to relate specific grammatical features of different dialects . the book concludes with discussions of the relevance of an understanding of accents and dialects to applied linguistics , an issue which is clearly important historically with the "" desirability-deficit "" debate and in contemporary education of english as a second language . in particular , the use of standardized tests which are based around the recognition of standard english usage and grammar are criticized for being unrealistic ( as well as violating assumptions of content validity ) . one solution might be to use a dialect consistency or achievement measure , and / or developing culturally and linguistically-appropriate testing situations which do not make assumptions about a language learner 's accent and / or social demographics . as the authors recognise , these kinds of aims are very difficult to implement , but certainly recognising the systematic biases in language testing , and encouraging dialect awareness in schools , is a first step . wolfram and schilling - estes explicitly accommodate pedagogical usage of this book , by introducing key concepts in capitals , and including an exercise for students with each new section in the text . at the conclusion of each chapter , there is a very useful "" further reading "" section which will also be useful to students , as will the glossary of common linguistic terms at the end of the book . a skeletal phonetics chart is accompanied by an appendix of socially-diagnostic structures , which will be useful for those working in clinical linguistics . the only criticism which could be levelled at the teaching material in the book is that no solutions are provided for the exercises , so perhaps the development of a separate teacher 's guide ( especially for foreign or tesol instructors ) might be an appropriate future inclusion to this otherwise impressive account of american english . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

- computational linguistics is far from the empirical approach of the translator , and this does not facilitate the introduction of new tools this paper will look at how the integration of cat tools in the translation process is a good mean to conciliate the practice of the translator and the reflection of the computational linguist . 15 . 25 discussion 15 . 35 tea 16 . 00 improving translation at the source - dawn murphy ( multilingual technology ltd . , uk ) improvements in the quality and efficiency of translation can be effected at the time of authoring . this paper will examine : - the concepts of controlled authoring and author memory and the supporting technologies - the benefits that such techniques provide for the author , the translator and the translation manager - the processes involved in developing such techniques within an organisation . 16 . 25 lcc - the language consulting centre - language consulting in cyber space - jeannette orsted ( danish association business language graduates ) lcc is a project supported by the european commission . the project is a partnership between teleport sachsen - anhalt gmbh ( de ) , centre for language technology ( dk ) , erhvervssprogligt forbund ( the danish association of business language graduates , dk ) and gesellschaft fur technische kommunikation e . v .

"complexity in language contact , acquisition and change","newsletter 1 . workshop on complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . 8 september 1998 , paris , france . in colaboration with the cnrs ( centre national de recherche scientifique ) , the lot ( netherlands graduate school of linguistics ) is organizing some workshops to create a forum to encourage the discussion between researchers in linguistics from the netherlands and france . one of the workshops is initiated by members of the university of amsterdam and has as its subject : complexity in language contact , acquisition and change . the workshop will take place on tuesday the 8th of september , starting at 14 . 30 until approximately 20 . 00h . the theme although there is a kind of dogma that all natural languages are equally complex , at least for certain subsystems of language there may well be differences in complexity . in discussions of processes of language change and first and second language acquisition the notion of complexity plays an important role . especially in creole studies simplicity and complexity implicitly have been dominant issues in the debate , but are seldom properly scrutinized . in this workshop we want to discuss the role of complexity in these domains , including grammatical theory , first and second language acquisition , language change and language contact - in order to shed light on controversial problems invoked by the term complexity in linguistics in general . the structure of the workshop the workshop is organized around three themes : creole languages , language acquisition and language change . each theme will be discussed by researchers from france and the netherlands in 10 minutes presentations , inspired by the following propositions . after these short presentations there will be time for discussion in each session . 1 . all languages have the same "" costs / payment "" balance , i . e . if a language becomes phonologically more simple , its morphological system will become more complex . [ cf . haugen 1976 : 286 ] 2 . all complexity in languages resides in the lexicon . [ cf . aronoff 1995 ] 3 . languages spoken within small communities are more complex than languages of large communities . [ cf . whinnom 1980 , hymes 1971 , mhlhusler 1996 ] 4 . language shift will in general lead to simplification , while borrowing will lead generally to more complex structures . [ cf . thomason & kaufman 1988 ] 5 . complexity does not play a role in first language acquisition , but it does in second language acquisition . [ cf . trudgill 1992 ] 6 . grammaticalization leads to greater complexity .

syntax,"nelson , diane carlita ; grammatical case assignment in finnish ; 0-8153 - 3180 - 0 , cloth ; pages , $ 65 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study presents an analysis of patterns of morphological case in finnish within the principles and parameters framework . finnish has a rich system of inflection for both case and agreement , making it an important language for testing hypotheses about the relationships between morphological case and abstract case , and case / case and agreement . the focus of the study is a set of syntactic environments where internal dp arguments appear in nominative case , but alternate with accusative pronouns . in the same contexts , internal arguments may also receive partitive case to encode features related to aspect or indefiniteness . because these environments lack an external argument coindexed with agreement , the data is particularly relevant to predictions made by burzio 's generalization . by testing burzio 's hypothesis systematically against a range of sentence types , finnish is shown to contain an ergative case subsystem within a nominative-accusative main system . the assignment of the objective cases is linked with the licensing of aspectual roles at d - structure , and finite tense is posited as a bi-unique case assigner . the case split then arises as the result of two case features being assigned simultaneously to an internal argument , objective case at d - structure associated with aspect , and nominative case at s - structure associated with finite tense where an external argument is not available . morphological spell-out rules for particular argument types are proposed which determine the surface case realization of doubly-case assigned nominals . e - mail : info @ garland . com

aspects of bilingualism in the ancient world,"aspects of bilingualism in the ancient world the university of reading , 2 - 4 april 1998 an international conference on bilingualism organised by prof . j . n . adams ( reading ) , prof . m . e . p . janse ( gent ) and dr s . c . r . swain ( warwick ) will be held at the university of reading from 2 - 4 april 1998 . sixteen invited speakers from britain and abroad will give papers . no attempt will be made to achieve a comprehensive coverage of language contact in the ancient mediterranean world , but the focus will instead be on greek and latin in contact both with each other and with other languages . it is intended that some papers should be linguistic in orientation ( i . e . that they should take account of recent research by linguists on bilingualism in modern societies , relating the findings if possible to issues of ancient bilingualism ) , but it is also obvious that historians and literary scholars commonly address problems related to language contact . we hope that the programme of papers will offer a combination of sociolinguistic , literary , cultural and historical approaches to the subject . conference program thursday , april 2 12 . 00 -

journees de rochebrune 99,"2nd and last call for papers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - journes de rochebrune 1999 : rencontres interdisciplinaires sur les systemes complexes naturels et artificiels du 31 janvier 1999 au 6 fevrier 1999 . appel a communications theme des journes 1999 toutes indications disponibles : http : / / www . idiap . ch / ~ glotin / rb99 . html conflits des interpretations et interpretation des conflits le robert definit l ' interpretation comme l ' activite de donner une signification que ce soit aux signes en general ou aux phnomenes . la connaissance que nous avons de cette activite est relativement peu structure au contraire de l ' activite de modelisation qui est specifique quoique dominante dans la science occidentale contemporaine . l ' interpretation peut se comprendre a la fois comme un processus et comme son resultat . elle peut donc etre difficilement separe de sa dynamique d ' elaboration . c ' est pourquoi nous voulons explorer plus precisement le role des conflits et antagonismes dont heraclite disait qu ' ils sont les seuls moteurs d ' evolution . le conflit ne doit pas forcement etre compris dans le sens de la logique classique dans laquelle il est source d ' incoherence ; ni dans le sens etymologique de forces qui se heurtent ce qui rendrait le conflit source de destruction , mais au contraire comme dynamique creatrice une fois placee dans un mecanisme d ' equilibration , possiblement par interpretation du conflit lui-meme . nous souhaitons poser les questions ( non-exhaustives ) suivantes : * le vivant interprete-t - il son environnement et quel sens donner a cette assertion ? entre adn et organisation cellulaire , qu ' en est-il de l ' embryogenese comme hermeneutique du vivant ? * quelle diffrence y a-t - il entre l ' interpretation par le vivant , l ' homme et la machine ? quels modeles en avons-nous et sont-ils conflictuels ? que nous apprend l ' ordinateur comme machine universelle a traiter le signe ? * quel est le role des conflits et antagonismes dans la construction d ' interpretation ? pourquoi les eviter et comment les utiliser ? * comment une interpretation individuelle est-elle possible ou qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation collective et du role de la multiplicite des points de vue , qu ' ils soient methodologiques , contextuels ou de niveaux , et donc des conflits qui peuvent en resulter ? qu ' en est-il de l ' interpretation comme resolution des conflits et donc moteur d ' evolution ? * si , comme dans la deuxieme definition du greimas ( voir notes ) , les signes sont toujours deja signifiants , comment peuvent-ils avoir ce statut ?

query : not not,"dear linguists , i am working on the double negative constructions like "" i did n't not come here "" and have been looking for the examples like that , but i can find only a few examples which i think does not cover all types of the double negatives . i would be very grateful if you could make a sen - tences using "" not not "" like the following examples and could agree with my analysis that they are basically "" understatements / litotes "" which obscure the speaker 's real intention . dr . larry horn 's _ a natural history of negation _ cites and exemplifies in detail such double negatives of "" not un - x "" constructions , but he made no comments on "" not not "" type . i assume that like "" not un - x "" , "" not not "" can imply not only "" understatements / litotes "" but also "" irony "" . do you agree with my analysis ? but unfortunately , i could find no examples of "" not not "" implying "" irony "" . bolinger ( 1980 ) states that "" a not unselfish act , you ' ll have to admit . "" is "" ironically euphemistic . "" i agree with him . but how ironi - cal ? what is the mechanism of such ironical euphemism and how does it arises ? can sperber and wilson 's ( 1981 , 1992 ) theory of "" echoic utterance "" cover all the types of such irony ? i would be grateful if you have a comment on this matter if any . the following are some of the examples i could collected : ( 1 ) a : you and jim really must come round to my place some evening . b : yes , we 'd like to . a : of course , you two do n't drink , do you ? b : well , we _ do n't not _ drink . ( hurford and heasley 1983 : 284 , _ semantics : a course book _ cup . ) minoru nakau ( 1994 ) _ nin - chi imiron no genri ( principles of cognitive semantics ) , taishukan , written in japanese , also quotes the above example , saying that b 's "" we do n't not drink "" is an echo or meta-lingui - stic expression of a 's words "" you two do n't drink "" , and also that b does not definitely say that they drink , rather obscure their intention and hesitate to admit they drink a lot . that is why b does n't say "" we do drink . "" in this sense , _ we do n't not drink _ can be quoted like _ we do n't "" not drink "" , where _ do n't _ is an external negation which negates the pre-negated assertion as inapproriate or false and "" not drink "" is an internal negation . the below two examples are also from nakau 's ( 1994 ) collection : ( 2 ) it is odd that _ coffee-grounds _ is plural . they may be "" composed of particles "" , but they are obviously _ not "" not _ too many for anyone to be able to count "" . the point is even more striking with _ dregs _ and _ lees _ , which are largely liquid . ( f . r . palmer , ( 1990 ) "" review articles : _ the semantics of grammar _ , by anna wierzbicka . "" _ journal of linguistics _ 26 : 223-233 . ) ( 3 ) for example , nouns such as _ heap _ or _ committee _ are _ not _ "" semantically plural but syntactically _ not _ plural "" . ( a . wierzbicka ( 1991 ) "" semantic rules know no exceptions . "" _ studies in language _ 15 , 371-398 . ) the next example is the one i found in r . b . parker 's novel _ valedic - tion _ ( 1984 ) . contrary to my analysis , this is not an understatement but some kind of emphatic expression . what do you think ? how do you interpret this example ? ( 4 ) susan said , "" i ' ve taken a job in san francisco . "" i put the glass down on the counter . i could feel myself begin to shrink inward . "" i ' m leaving tonight , "" she said . "" i had planned to stay the night with you and tell you in the morning , but i can't . i _ can't not _ tell you . "" ( r . b . parker , _ valediction _ , p . 19 ) my interpretation of the sentences in question is that "" . . . , but i can't ( tell you in the morning ) . ( but ) i _ can't not _ tell = can't help telling you ( now ) . "" "" can't "" is echoed and the abbreaviated adverbials are different . is my interpretation correct ? i would be very grateful if you reply to me . thanks a lot in advance . best wishes , hiroaki tanaka , faculty of integrated arts and sciences , tokushima university , japan . e - mail : hiro-t @ ias . tokushima-u . ac . jp

"judgment fatigue : summary , part i","summary of responses to request for information on judgment fatigue ( also called syntactic satiation ) original post : linguist list : vol-6 - 974 . mon jul 17 1995 . issn : 1068-4875 . special thanks to the following respondents : kimberly barskaitiki , tim beasley , elizabeth bergman , michael bernstein , vivian cook , joseph davis , rianne doeleman , karen emmorey , suzette haden elgin , ted harding , stephen helmreich , erika l . konrad , john e . limber , bruce nevin , john robert ross , carson t schutze , linda shockey , william snyder , karin stromswold , joyce tang boyland , anyone i may have missed , and anyone who thought about responding but has n't yet . karin stromswold and william snyder have actually investigated this phenomenon . i have not read either of their papers yet , but i look forward to doing so . william snyder ( snyder @ psyche . mit . edu ) presented a poster on this topic at lsa 1994 , which was mentioned in rick hudson 's summary post of july 29 , 1994 . individual 's interested in dr . snyder 's poster should contact him directly . hudson 's post ( linguist list : vol-5 - 855 . fri 29 jul 1994 . issn : 1068-4875 . ) summarized the literature available which addresses the difference between linguists ' and non-linguists ' intuitions . hudson also mentions ( but does not cite ) four references provided by joyce tang boyland regarding satiation effects ( both syntactic and semantic ) . hudson 's original post is available from linguist list archives . joyce tang boyland 's response is included below ( in part ii of post , following ) . karin stromswold 's response ( karin @ muddle . rutgers . edu ) was my connection to snyder , hudson , and boyland . her post is most relevant to my original query and is included in its entirety below ( in part ii of post , following ) . most responses mentioned the influence of continual or repeated exposure over a period of time , either mentioning examples similar to perceptual or semantic satiation such as a word-repetition effect . ( bergman , cook , davis , doeleman , haden elgin , harding , helmreich , limber , schutze , snyder , stromswold , tang boyland ) . there are many differences , however , between the effects of semantic satiation and "" syntactic satiation "" or judgment fatigue : first , semantic satiation is the detachment of form and meaning which occurs as you continuously repeat some lexical item ( see also stromswold 's post below ) . judgment fatigue , in contrast , cannot be induced by the repeated presentation of any sentence . in fact , published experiments by nagata show that raters ' intuitions only become more stringent on repeated presentation . second , the loss of the meaning of a sentence is not an effect of judgment fatigue . the meaning of the sentence may be quite lucid to the individual reading it , but that individual 's attention is focused upon some aspect of the grammatical acceptability of the sentence , and it is the ability to judge grammatical acceptability which is lost , not the ability to make sense of the utterance . third , while the particular characteristics of the stimuli which induce judgment fatigue are not yet fully established , it appears that different types of sentences induce the effect to different degrees ( stromswold , snyder as cited in hudson 's post ) . this is not the case for semantic satiation , where the repetition of any lexical item can induce the effect . fourth , the "" scanting out "" effect as noted by haj ross points out that the loss of intuition can be triggered by one single stimuli , not necessarily the repeated presentation of numerous stimuli ( relevant quote posted below ) . conversely , subjects can rate hundreds of stimuli on the basis of grammaticality , with no fatigue effect ( beyond boredom ) , even if the stimuli contain permutation of the same lexical items , be they open or closed class items . note that point four is definitely true in the case that the stimuli are all dichotomously "" great - - grammatical "" or "" horrible - - ungrammatical "" . there is a definite influence of marginality , an effect which , to date , i believe no one has explained . fifth , semantic satiation ( as well as perceptual fatigue effects ) is often attributed to some type of neurological fatigue at the cortical level . this could not be the ( only ) reason for judgment fatigue , however , because there may not be any single word or syntactic structure which is repeated in all of the stimuli ( such as could be the case for judgment fatigue induced by the scope of negation or negative polarity items ) . for this reason , it would be quite implausible to claim that judgment fatigue is the result of some type of physiological / chemical / neurological saturation which has occurred at the cortical level . at this point , i do not believe judgment fatigue and semantic satiation have much in common as behavioral disturbances . ( incidently , while i am not an expert on semantic satiation , i have not yet been forced by the evidence to believe that semantic satiation is the result of a low-level neurological fatigue . perceptual fatigue is a neurological phenomenon , but i attribute semantic satiation to other conceptual strategies . ) many linguists ( beasley , nevin , konrad , and one anonymous ) also observed ' that the longer you stay in linguistics , the less you speak english . ' to quote from bruce nevin 's response : < < a student was once asked , in my hearing , if a certain famous linguist was a native speaker of english . the reply : ' i think he used to be . ' > > hudson 's previous summation further confirms that linguists and non-linguists do demonstrate significantly different abilities in discriminating grammatical and ungrammatical sentences . this type of long-term "" drift "" of linguists ' judgments may be of interest in its own regard , but this type of "" judgment drift "" is not identical to the temporary loss of linguistic intuition which i intended to address . as noted by beasley and konrad , it may indeed be the case that exposure to second languages , exposure to dialects different from ones native dialect , or exposure to a large number of perhaps marginal sentences which occur rarely in natural spoken or written contexts ( such as sentences demonstrating violations of theoretical principals such as "" weak crossover "" or "" island constraints "" , for example ) may actually alter an individual 's criteria for grammatical acceptability . if one understands judgments of grammatical acceptability to be metalinguistic type-categorizations , then one may expect that an individual 's discriminative ability will be altered based upon that individual 's personal experiences with exemplars of the categories . others commented that judgment fatigue does not happen if the stimuli are contextualized ( davis , nevin ) or if the referential situation is more concrete rather than abstract ( davis , doeleman , nevin ) . this is not the case . a loss of linguistic intuition of grammatical acceptability definitely can happen spontaneously , such as while one is listening to a conversation or reading texts , regardless of the concreteness of the topic , with the following qualifications : judgment fatigue is inspired only by particular types of stimuli ( which have not yet been clearly defined , but see part ii of post , following ) and by the listener 's / reader 's focus upon the grammar of the utterance or sentence . other individuals related hard-to - comprehend sentences as examples inducing judgment fatigue . some such sentences , notably sentences involving scope ambiguity , may induce confusion , but confusion is not synonymous with the loss of ones own linguistic intuitions . for ambiguous or confusing stimuli , we say , "" someone should rewrite this sentence . it is ambiguous ( or anomalous ) . "" when we have judgment fatigue , we say , "" i ' m a monoglot , but damned if i can decide whether this sentence is grammatical . i sure do n't feel like a native english speaker ! "" lastly , some responses or general expressions of empathy or encouragement , and actual examples ( barskaitiki , emmorey , shockey ) . thank you again to all who responded . if you are interested in the current proposal for my experiments , or if you would like to hear more about the results and conclusions from the experiments when i am finished running them , please contact me . please see part ii ( posted separately ) for selected quotes from respondents .

re : 5 . 1333 native speaker intuitions,"may i add my quantum of intuitive ( non-syntactician 's , nay non-linguist 's ) data to this discussion : ) date : sun , 20 nov 1994 12 : 41 : 23 gmt + 1200 ) from : wayne lawrence ( wp . lawrence @ auckland . ac . nz ) ) subject : re : sum : native speaker intuitions ) ) marilyn silva recently summarised responses dealing with "" native ) speaker intuitions "" , especially with respect to the sentence ' john ) asked mary to leave ' . she notes that several respondents pointed out ) that the interpretation of this sentence is determined , at least in ) part , pragmatically , and the view that the interpretation is ) syntactically fixed is wrong . this point is demonstrated by the ) ) pair of examples : ) ) ) ) [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . ) ) [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . ) ) i am a native speaker of english ( new zealand english ) , and i am not ) a syntactician , so i do n't think my syntax is being moulded by my , or ) anyone else 's , rules or theories , but , in both [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , i can ) only interpret the person being asked ( the child in [ 1 ] , the teacher ) in [ 2 ] ) as being the person required to leave the room . there is ( in my intuition ) an undoubted pragmatic element . in both cases , the teacher is supposed to be in authority and the child not . therefore [ 1 ] causes no hesitation and immediately evokes a normal situation : the teacher made a request to the child that the child leave the room . case [ 2 ] immediately evokes a picture that the child made a request to the teacher that the teacher leave the room . given the presupposed authority relationship , intuition says "" hold on ! kids do n't do that ! "" - except in special circumstances . so look for a special context ( ? classrom game ? ) or try a possible re-interpretation . for the latter , remember the form "" the child asked to leave the room "" ( teacher implicit ) and admit that [ 2 ] is a possible way of saying it ( teacher explicit ) . however , i have to agree with wayne lawrence that the immediate intrepretation is as his : the person being asked is expected to leave . this interpretation is a function of syntax . only when you have "" had a look "" at the syntactically generated interpretation do pragmatic constraints force you to re-consider . it is , i report for myself , a distinctly two-stage process , and the second is only triggered if there are problems with the result of the first . in the case , however , of "" john asked mary to leave "" there is nothing given corresponding to the authority relationship which would make it unlikely that john expects mary to leave , and in that case , i am afraid , syntax has it . ted .

"rate of loss for "" basic "" vocabulary","some months ago there was an extended discussion of the proposal made in the fifties by swadesh that there are certain lists of meanings which have the property that the words expressing them are lost at a fairly constant rate per millennium in all languages , in particular , a certain 100 - meaning list where the rate is around 86 % . while noting that bergsland and vogt have adduced examples where the rate seems to be lower , i pointed out that i had not found any examples where it was clearly higher . jacques guy referred to the eastern greenlandic data discussed by bergsland and vogt in current anthropology in 1962 , but , having just carefully read this paper , i see that they state that , while they surmise that the rate here was higher , they cannot calculate what is was ( presuumably because there are no sources for greenlandic that are old enough ) . moreover , the purely conjectural rate of 72 % which they mention is still low enough for the purposes of the original discussion we were having about this , namely , to assure that in a family with enough ramification there would be a substantial portion of the original vocabulary reflected in at least two descendants after far more than 10 , 000 years ( provided each language was independely losing 28 % of the original vocabulary per millennium ) . i do n't have the numbers handy , but jacques , who is better at this anyway , can probably whip some up . but i should also add that bergsland nd vogt 's data are also consistent with many other assumptions , notably , that the rate of retention in e . greenlandic was 86 % , but that it was substanitally lower in some other eskimo languages ( because all they have is the result that e . greenlandic is as different lexically from w . greenlandic as the two together are from yupik , which makes no sense given the family tree if the rates are the same eveywhere ) . but this could be due to slower vocabulary loss in yupik ( or even in the common ancestror of e . and w . greenlandic , or both ) just as well as to faster loss in e . greenlandic . so there is no justification that i can find for bergsland and vogt 's or guy 's assumption that the "" prolem "" lies in a faster rate of loss in e . greenlandic .

re : 5 . 1467 qs : metaling,"ther term "" metalinguistics "" comes from benjamin lee whorf . see his books "" collecteed papers of metalinguistics "" ( washington , 1952 ) , "" four lectures on metalinguistics "" ( washington , 1952 ) , "" language , thought , and reality "" ( new york , 1956 ) . whorf defines this branch of science as studying the relations between the language and related phenomena such as thought , society and culture . so , it includes such fields as psycho - , socio - , ethno - , neuro . . . linguistics . the other source is g . l . trager 's article "" the field of linguistics "" ( studies in linguistic . occasional papers . i "" . oclahoma , 1949 ) , but in a slight different sense . e . hamp criticised trager for using the term "" metalinguistics "" for the field that is usually called "" semantics "" ( see : e . hamp , "" the glossary of american linguistic technical use "" , the article called "" metalinguistis "" ) . this is really an americanism . in saussurean tradition the term "" external linguistics "" is preferred , as opposed to the "" internal linguistics "" ( = whorf 's "" microlinguistics "" ) . the corresponding adjective sounds like "" extralinguistic "" . because of that i prefer to call this branch not "" metalinguistics "" but "" extralinguistics "" ! but there is another meaning of the term "" metalinguistics "" . it is derived from the "" metalanguage "" ( a logical notion that comes from husserl , russel , tarski , carnap ) . that is , metalinguistics in this sense is defined as "" the studying of metalanguages "" . i prefer to use the word "" metalinguistics "" in this sense . ) from the hamp 's critique one can deduc e that he likes this logical tradition , too . but i am not sure who was the first . with best regards , sergej a . krylov ursula doleschal & sergej krylov institut f . slawische sprachen wirtschaftsuniv . wien augasse 9 , 1090 wien tel . : + + 43 - 1-31336 4115 fax : + + 43 - 1-31336 744

linguist / phonetic request for information,"dear linguist , this is a request for information regarding the kinds of pronunciation that are possible for a person who has no tongue , for the purpose of the editing of a novel set in 11th - 12th - century spain . a man has had his tongue removed at the root , so that he may not speak what he has seen . what sounds would he be able to make , after the wound has healed , but before he has practised much ? at the moment he uses a lot of sibilants , which i would imagine to be impossible , except for some kind of sshhing sound . with my limited knowledge , i 'd have thought he 'd have been limited to labials and fricatives - m , p , b , f , v , w . and h ? what about vowels ? the words he presently attempts to articulate are listed below . tongueless approximations forthese would be most gratefully received . take velaz ammar muwardis what happened why more where yes galleenus care jehane eliane i am so sorry do n't think historic pronunciation of the spanish / moorish need to be taken account of . could you please reply to seaboyer @ epas . utoronto . ca many thanks , jude seaboyer

"comparative syntax : two languages , one grammar ?","i previously posted this text to another mailing list ; a participant on that list , who also reads linguist , urged me to post it here as well , as a contribution to the "" comparative syntax "" discussion . the text below , set off by "" # "" in the left margin , is drawn from ) man 's many voices : language in its cultural context ( , by robbins burling ( new york : holt rhinehart & winston , 1970 ; isbn 0-03 - 081001-09 ) . # john gumperz has examined the colloquial dialects of marathi and kannada # in a village along the maharastra - mysore boundary in central india where # these two languages come into direct contact . marathi is an indo - aryan # language , while kannada is dravidian . historically these two languages # go back to utterly different antecedents , but the indo - aryan and dravidian # languages have been in contact in india for several thousand years and have # long influenced one another . along the borders their mutual influence has # been profound . in the village studied by gumperz most speakers feel # themselves to be bilingual , but the two village dialects share such a # large part of their grammar that one can almost doubt whether they should # count as separate languages . consider , for example , the following sentence : # # kannada : hog - i w @ nd kudri turg mar - i aw t @ nd # tags : verb suff . adj . noun noun verb suff . pron . verb # marathi : ja - un ek ghora cori kar - un tew anla # english : go having one horse theft take having he brought # idiomatic english : having gone and having stolen a horse , # he brought it back . # # all of the morphemes of the kannada sentence are different from those of # the marathi sentence , but they are used according to identical grammatical # principles . the sentences have identical constituent structures and their # morphemes occur in the same order . the same kind of suffixes are attached # to the same kind of bases . these sentences seem by no means to be atypical # of village usage . in fact , one can plausibly suggest that these two # languages ( if indeed they ) are ( two languages ) have the same grammar and # differ only in the items filling the surface forms . one can translate from # one language to another simply by substituting one set of lexical items for # another in the surface structure . # # both the marathi and the kannada used in this village differ from the more # literary or educated styles of the same languages , but both can be shown to # be related to the more standard forms according to the usual criteria by # which linguists recognize genetic affiliation . yet the village dialects # have undergone such profound mutual grammatical influence as to almost # obscure the boundaries between the two languages . curiously , in this case , # it is the lexicon that maintains the separation , and after considering the # effect of marathi and kannada upon each other , one can hardly maintain that # lexicon is always the easiest component of language to borrow or that the # true genetic affiliation will necessarily be shown by the underlying grammar burling 's bibliography refers to the following article ( which i have not read ) : gumperz , john j .

query : pseudo - explanations,"i am trying to collect examples of pseudo-explanations of linguistic phenomena which invoke supposed beliefs or customs such as the following : ( a ) hopi pluralizes the word for ' cloud ' the way that it usually pluralizes only animate nouns , so whorf claimed that this proves that the hopis believe clouds to be alive , ( b ) malagasy and some other languages tend to use passive rather than active voice forms in imperatives , so it is has often been claimed ( i even did this myself once ) that this is a matter of politeness , because by using a passive you are avoiding actually ordering the addressing around , while still making it clear what you want done . ( c ) one of the languages of the torres straits uses the dual in speaking to a married woman , and this was explained by saying that a married woman was assumed to have a child with her ! ! ! ( d ) there is even the famous case of a russian work which claimed that the adjective * beremennyj * ' pregnant ' had no masculine forms ( like the one i just cited ) because only females can get pregnant and then used this very form , saying that a "" beremennyj muzhchina "" ( = "" pregnant - masc man "" ) is inconceivable ! these are the kinds of things i would like to collect . and it would be especially if there were a case where the explanation was valid and not pseudo , of course , please send the examples to me and i will post a summary .

on vacation,"dear subscribers : it 's the holiday season here in the usa , so we want to extend good wishes for the festive season and also to let you know that linguist will be "" on vacation "" from december 20 ( midnight ) to january 5 , 1995 . we ' re taking a break this year because we have been plagued with technical problems all semester : first our mailer started wildly duplicating and triplicating messages ; then we began having problems ( still unsolved ) telnetting from emu to texas a&m ; and now we are being moved to a new machine at texas a&m . ( come to think of it - - why did we say this was going to be a "" holiday "" ? ? ) we will be spending the break doing what we can to ensure that 1995 is less technically "" interesting "" . we want to thank all of you who have been patient with late postings , duplicate postings , and lost messages from september to december . and we wish to extend hearty thanks to our assistant editors , ron reck , ljuba veselinova , liz bodenmiller , and ann dizdar , who have manned the front lines in our battle with technology : it is because of their excellent work that linguist was able to continue all semester despite the revolt of the machines . some of you may be interested to know that linguist now has 5700 subscribers , who have posted this year 's 1500 messages from approximately 60 different countries . may all 5700 of you have a prosperous and happy new year ! helen & anthony

re : 5 . 1459 native speaker intuition,"after what i said last time about "" of "" in "" could of "" etc . , i have to think about why the six year-old said "" could of "" was a "" long "" way to say "" coulda ( ? ) "" it 's clear she does n't see "" have "" in "" coulda "" , and that leads to other questions about whether the relationship between the verb "" have "" and the last syllable in "" coulda / v "" etc is anything more than graphic and literate itself at this point in time . note that the big clue , the participle after "" have "" is losing reliability thru ever-spreading merger of participles and pasts in english , e . g , "" could of went "" / "" i ' ve went "" . only "" been "" is a true-blue participle through thick and thin . but it is probably not sufficient to allow six year-olds ( or maybe anybody else for that matter ) to recognise that the "" of "" in "" coulda "" is "" have "" . if this is so , then have / of only alternate ( as a function of stress ) when there is no modal . the other part of the question concerns the association of "" of "" from "" have "" with "" of "" ( from "" off "" ) . it still seems to me , the little girl gave no indication that she saw "" could of "" as containing the word "" of "" , though it would be interesting to know what she thinks a word is . are homophones the same word , for example . "" of "" is "" longer "" than "" a "" in any case . i think that was the question she was asked . i ' m afraid to look now , because i ' ll lose this stimulating posting . . . . if she insists that the "" of "" in "" could-of "" is indeed the same word , i 'd be interested in her explanation for why she thinks so . alexis might also be interested in such an explanation for his folk etymology collection . benji

""" sum : have / hold / compulsion / existence","about a month ago , i posted an enquiry asking for help in finding non - ie languages , in which there was a connection between any of the following expressions : ' hold ' and ' possess ' , synchronically or diachronically ' exist ' and ' possess ' ' must / should ' and ' possess ' and i was quite happy about the enthusiastic reponse ( around 20 of you contacted me ) . so , for all who are interested , here is a short summary . i hope i have n't left anyone out and that i have n't confused anything , as i know next to nothing about the languages you all told me about . there was also the small 'd isaster ' with my email - i accidentally deleted some of your answers , so i apologize if you answered but do n't find your name in the list . i would like to take the chance now to thank all those who did answer with information on the following languages : japanese : here , the verb mot - ' hold ' can also be used to a large extent for ' possess ' , but not for ' existence ' or ' compulsion ' also , an anonymous reply pointed out another construction for ' possess ' with aru - ' exist ' , but was not sure about the difference in meaning between ' possess ' with mot - and ' possess ' with aru . basque : * edun ( nowadays - du - ) is used for possession and as an auxiliary . in addition , in the south , the verb eduki ' hold ' has also to some extent been grammaticalized to denote ' possess ' and also ' perfect ' with transitive verbs , while intransitives form the perfect with izan ' be ' . this development seems to be following the lines of the development latin ) romance . hebrew : there is no verb ' possess ' in hebrew : possession is expressed periphrastically ( with the "" dative "" ) . interestingly , here also there is a connection between ' possess ' and ' compulsion ' and ' existence ' , which all apparently use this construction . aramaic : in many aramaic dialects , the earlier construction ' past participle + dative ( ' l ' ) + pronoun ' became the past tense . l is now predominantly used for a goal with verbs of motion , but is also used for possession . arabic : in cairene colloquial arabic , @ anda ' at / near / by ' is used for possession and is then negated like a verb , not like a preposition . tamil iru ' be ( located ) ' + dative is used for possession and for durative / continuous aspect , but not for perfect / perfective . kol ' hold ' , although not used for ' possess ' can be combined with iru and denotes that the action is one of the following : self-benefactive , reflexive , deliberate and / or accidental ( depending on what was expected ) . crow : ' exist ' / ' not-exist ' is not only used for existence but also ' possess ' and perfective aspect . finish : pitaa ' hold ' can also be used to express ' compulsion ' but interestingly , not ' possess ' . dakota : yuha ' hold ' may also be used to some extent for ' have ' , otherwise ' be with ' is used . chinese : yong3yiu3 , where yong3 denotes ' embrace ' , can also be used to express ' possess , own ' . to stress that one has total control , one may use zhung3yiu3 , where zhung3 denotes ' hold in one 's palm ' ( yiu3 is ' possess ' , ' existence ' and can also be used for ' perfect ' with questions and negative statements ) idg * ghebh ' give ' -

( it is obtainable with ftp ) . windows vs . mac [ there are more than twice as much pcs out there than mac 's , but perhaps among linguists the percentages are more even . i ' m not ready to change though . i am quite happy with pcs thank you very much . ] you do n't say whether you ' re a mac or pc person , but the reviews of word 6 for mac were uniformly enormously negative : they actually ported woindows onto the mac ! since we mac users continually have to escape the really lousy windows imitations of things the mac does gracefully , we can't imaging why they did that ! the macuser review recommended nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now ( and if you are evern going to use alien scripts , there 's no substitute ) ; but you shluld also look at framemaker ( abvailable for lots of platforms , ioncluding windows ) ; it can number an idefinitely large number of different series , cross-refer between chapters that are separate files , etc . it only is n't woldscript - sensitive . ( version 4 . 0 . 4 was sort of , but was buggy , and in the just-released version 5 , they abancdoned it . ) wordperfect vs . word [ the advantage of wp for linguists is definitely the special characters it supports , though the special fonts that come with wp ( which are true type ) will work , i believe , with word , so word users can get a hold of these true type fonts from their wp user friends . ] i am in a similar situation : my new office computer came with microsoft office , which includes word . i toyed with the idea of switching from word perfect , but after a minimal amount of tinkering with word , i have about abandoned the idea . the main reason , for me , is that word perfect comes with a fairly extensive set of special characters , which i use a lot . they include several foreign alphabets , most of the ipa alphabet , characters for logical notation , and so forth . word , as far as i can tell , comes with hardly any of these . so i have about decided to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use . numbered examples [ word can indeed number examples or anything at all . the terminology is a bit different though , which is why i was confused . in wp you set up counters , but in word you set up sequences . ] [ several people told me that they had gotten this to work , though they did n't all know how they did it . however , after they pointed me in the right direction , i was able to figure it out . ] you set up a counter by using the seq field ( look in your manual under fields ) . fields are somewhat like codes in wordperfect , they have links to things like counters ( chapter number , section , number ) or dates , file names , etc . one of the fields is seq . ( a ) chose : insert / field , click seq , which will give you a seq in the bottom window ; add "" ex / n "" to the right of the seq code in lower window , press return ( the ex is the name or identifier for the counter , the / n is to increase the number by 1 ) . the first time you do this a 1 will show up , the second a 2 , etc . ( you can set up more than one such counter / sequence by giving each sequence a diferent name an identifier ) ( there are many predefined sequences , e . g . { seq chapter } refers to chapter numbers . ) ( b ) you can create a macro , which then you can assign to a button or a key combination , which does : 1 ) choose a paragraph type you ' ve created which has the right margins , font size , etc . for your example paragraph ; and 2 ) right tab , ( , the stuff in ( a ) above , ) , left tab . ( c ) cross - referencing examples : very easy . first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to cross-reference : a ) highlight the number created in ( a ) above ( along with the parentheses ) . b ) choose edit / bookmark , give the bookmark a name ( 40 characters ) , e . g . donkey _ sentence c ) when you want to refer to it , you type , e . g . , "" as we saw in example "" ; then you click insert / cross - reference , click bookmark , click the name of the bookmark , click insert . of course , many of these operations can be simplified with macros . there are many possibilities that i have n't mentioned . for instance , if you want to number the examples in ch . 3 in the format ( 3 . 1 ) , all you have to is before you insert the field for seq , you insert the field for the chapter . ] help on numbering in word 2 came from : numbering examples in dos : you are right , the automatic numbering of examples in word ( . 4 , . 5 & . 6 ) is inexistant which is a problem for linguists since we deal with a lot of examples in our text . if this can be of any interst for you i have found an excellent programm which allows me to do automatic numbering of examples as well as cross-references to examples in the text . the name of the program is renumber 1 . 2 and you can get it by writing to : jonathan mead ; 356 no . spaulding ave . ; los angele , ca ; usa 90036 or by e-mailing jonathan at : izzyt09 @ uclamvs i have been told that the fees for this programm are $ 15 . for student and $ 20 . for non student . [ i have used renumber in the past , and it works well . it is not as convenient as the features in word and wordperfect though . ] powerful searches if you are a mac user and are looking for super-sophisticated searching , try nisus which uses grep conventions and is the best going that i know of . regarding your 's earch ' question , there is a * lot * of stuff available out there , depending on the scope of your intended use . . . . if you ' re just going for personal use on 1 pc , you may want to look at eclipse find , not free , but only $ 99 , last time i looked .

summary : sri lanka,"a few weeks ago i asked the following question : > could somebody please tell me how sri lanka is written and > pronounced in spanish ? is the pronunciation uniform across latin > america ? my reason for asking was that one of my students , a peruvian , told me it was pronounced / esrilanka / . yet i seemed to recall that a mexican had once told me it was / sirlanka / . as you will see below , i was wrong but only partly . here are the responses i received : en reponse a ton mail sur la prononciation de sri lanka en espagnol , je peux dire qu ' en amerique du sud ( chili , argentine ) , on prononce et on ecrit siri lanka . my latin american friends tell me ' sri lanka ' is pronounced just as one would expect : sri lanka ( with the dental-alveolar [ r ] and the velar nasal . ) they say it is spelled as you have spelled it . en respuesta a su pregunta sobre la escritura y la pronunciacion de sri lanka en espanol , le puedo decir lo siguiente : en cuanto a la escritura , si no me equivoco , se mantiene el original sri lanka . sin embargo , en cuanto a la pronunciacion , existe la tendencia general a intercalar una i de apoyo entre la s y la r : [ siri ] . ello no excluye que ciertos individuos , considerandose mas "" cultos "" y mas "" sabios "" , hagan el esfuerzo de pronunciar [ sri ] . esfuerzo que rompe con la tendencia del espanol de evitar toda s liquida . esfuerzo , por consiguiente , considerado "" no natural "" . con respecto a la pronunciacion en latinoamerica , no puedo decirle gran cosa . pero imagino que tambien se ha generalizado la tendecia fonetica a intercalar la vocal i . i pronounce it [ ezri ' la ' nka ] , r = trill , n = velar nasal in normal speech . in rapid speech the [ z ] assimilates to the following rhotic producing a sound of intermediate quality ( this assimilation is a well known fact of spanish phonetics in nonaspirating dialects described , for instance , in navarro tomas ' standard manual ) . in slow speech [ esri ' ] , without voicing . i am from spain . in aspirating dialects , it is [ ehri ' ] ~ [ eri ' ] . i am from seville ( spain ) . i write the name of the country as sri lanka . and i pronounce it / sri lanka / . ( i might also pronounce it as / esri lanka / ; but this is due to the fact that we do n't like sequences / sc / as onsets of words . you may have already realized that if you have listened to spanish people speaking english . many of the them would say / espein / instead of / spein / ) . in argentina sri lanka is pronounced : [ siri lanka ] . the [ r ] sound is according to ipa : is a post-dental percusive sound . the [ n ] is velar . i just called my daughter who is a writer at la jornada , a local newspaper . she works in the economics section . she said that their spelling is just like english , although she supposes that some "" purist "" publications probably change the k for a c . she wrote sri lanka on a piece of paper and asked the 5 people who were in the office to pronounce it . she confirmed my own suspicion that people pronounce it as if it were in spanish - - two of them with a rather marked e at the beginning , which is what spanish phonology would require with st - , for instance . the rest of us tend to sonorize the s - , but that would be expected in mexican spanish anyway . so , her conclusion ( and mine - - we ' re both speakers of spanish as a 1st lang ) is that it 's pronounced "" normally . "" she has worked with a number of argentine journalists and never noticed that they did anything worth noting , which means that they probably pronounce it just about the same . from : in % "" penaja @ wkuvx1 . wku . edu "" juan antonio pena as far as spelling , sri lanka is the spanish orthography for this asian country . as far as phonetics , the only thing worth noting is that we insert an ' e ' [ e ] sound at the beginning of the word sri . spanish does this with all words beginning s + any stop consonant . in spain , the name of the state is written as in english : sri lanka ( the geographical name of the island is ceilan - - with an accent on the ' a ' ) . the pronunciation ( in tv and broadcasting ) varies : some people says [ sri ' lanka ] , some others [ esri ' lanka ] ( r stands for the multiple trill of - rr - in spanish , the same sound as in perro ) . hear in spain we use to pronounce the name of the old island of ceilan in two different ways . the most common pronunciation is [ esrri lan , ka ] ( i use double r for the spanish hard r and [ n , ] for the velarized nasal sound ) . there is another pronunciation , not so common as the former : [ siri lan , ka ] . i do not know the origin of this one . so there you have it . my impression is that / esrilanka / is more common in spain , and / sirilanka / more prevalent in south america , but this is obviously not absolute . many thanks to all those who responded . marc picard

sum : native speaker intuitions,"several weeks ago i posted a question about the current status of "" native speaker intutions "" in our discipline . in particular , i wondered about the problems posed by variations in the interpretation of sentences . such variations sometimes become apparent when i teach "" modern english grammar , "" a course that treats english syntax in nonformal , surface-structure terms and primarily is aimed at nonlinguists . in my post , i mentioned two sentences that gave rise to varying intuitions , but i will discuss in this summary only the first , viz . , "" john asked mary to leave , "" which one student claimed was ambiguous between the reading where mary would do the leaving and that in which john would do the leaving . she claimed she got this second reading by thinking something like "" john asked to leave , "" which clearly means that john would leave , and who he asked was mary . before i continue this discussion , i must point out that in my class i did not solicit interpretations of this sentence , nor did i expect any challenges to my reading , which i essentially presupposed , assuming - - erroneously - - that all my students saw it as i did . perhaps i did not make this point clear in my posting to this list , since several respondents implied that problems will arise when we solicit interpretations or judgments , or indeed if we do "" generative "" grammar at all . however , though my approach to syntax in this course is not generative and i did not request an interpretation for this sentence , students sometimes will challenge my assumptions about meaning . if the students involved were merely contentious , then i would chalk up such differences to personality and continue unabashed . but describing my students as contentious in this case would certainly be a distortion . their observations arose , it seems to me , out of a genuine desire to come to grips with the issue . several respondents pointed out that recent research in syntax has had to deal with the thorny issue of interpretation . georgia green reports that one of her students , tim williams , "" has just completed a dissertation on infinitive complements , and one of the major points is that , as illustrated by the reaction to . . . ' john asked mary to leave , ' the subject of the infinitive in so - called equi constructions is not syntactically fixed . ( his dissertation deals with articulating the pragmatic principles that govern the interpretation , and misled us for so long into thinking that the interpretation was syntactically fixed . ) "" both dan alford and dale russell noted that the interpretation of a sentence such as "" john asked mary to leave "" as meaning "" john asked mary 's permission to leave "" could be enhanced if there were a power / status differential between the two nps . dale wrote that "" real-world stuff makes us lean toward one [ reading ] or the other to the point where we ' re not even aware of the potential ambiguity . "" he provides an example of such real-world stuff in "" johnny asked the teacher to go get a drink of water , "" a sentence in which it is far easier to read the subject of the sentence as also being the subject of the infinitive . he points out that "" we ' ve only changed lexical items , made the first object someone who is likely to be in a position to grant permission , and the subject of the sentence someone who is likely to want to perform the action of the infinitival . "" following this line of inquiry , tony bex offers an enlightening pair of examples : [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . he contends that these sentences "" are typically interpreted pragmatically taking into account perceived authority ; i . e . , in [ 1 ] the teacher tells the child to leave ; in [ 2 ] the child asks whether s / he can leave . "" in either case , it is likely that it is the child who will be leaving . i should note that this pair of examples proved to be particularly amusing and illuminating to my students - - especially to those who , like me , found the ' permission ' reading peculiar . tony 's examples demonstrated to them to what extent pragmatic knowledge plays a part in interpretation . the responses to the infinitive problem constituted only one of several lines pursued by my respondents . some , who like me teach undergraduate syntax courses , commented on the difficulty a few students have with even rudimentary syntactic analysis ( e . g . , the subject / predicate split , often claimed to be a universal strategy among english speakers ) . others commented on the familiar problem of intuition fatigue ( which could be summed up as "" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a good string 50 times and it sounds weird "" ) . and still others took issue with the entire enterprise of a separate syntax , particularly of the generative variety , though by now it should be clear that any decontextualized sentence has the potential to give rise to more than one intepretation . in fact this very idea is discussed in carson schutze 's forthcoming book , _ the empirical base of linguistics : grammaticality judgments and linguistic methodology _ , to be published by university of chicago press in 1995 . in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data "" can provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . "" finally , one last thread was contributed by larry hutchinson , who mentioned the history of introspection in this century : "" in point of fact , the first psychology labs had been set up by introspectionists , but they were completely taken over by behaviorists and introspection dumped . . . . linguists in the 50 's were pretty much under the sway of behaviorists , and emotionally against introspectionism . . . . but then the enthusiasm generated by chomsky just swept away the behaviorist viewpoint , and along with it the contempt for the unguided use of speaker opinions . "" i thank all of my respondents ( cited below ) for their insightful and helpful remarks . i hope i have not distorted their positions in any serious way . marilyn silva respondents : dan alford , mark arnold , laurie bauer , kirk belnap , tony bex , scott delancey , jakob dempsey , susan ervin - tripp , georgia green , larry hutchinson , ingo plag , jim jewett , jules levin , chris li , steve matthews , dan maxwell , micheal palmer , jeanmarie rouhier , dale russell , mary ellen ryder , carson schutze , linda shockey , jacques steyn , and one respondent who prefers to remain anonymous

open letter to * language *,"sally 's posting in response to the open letter indicates that * language * has decided to have illich - svitych 's book reviewed . that is good news - - unless this refers merely to the fact that late in 1990 or early in 1991 she asked eric hamp to do a review , which to my knowlege he declined to do . if indeed eric hamp is now going to review the book , i will be delighted . but it is not the case ( as some have charged ) that the open letter was written in spite of the fact that the signers knew , or could have found out , that a review was in the works . we were informed that hamp had declined . as recently as march 7 , 1994 , the language advisory committee seemed to have no knowledge of such a review . in response to an appeal from me , the committee urged that * language * do something on this issue , but in july * language * informed me that it would not . this , together with the fact that the incoming editor of * language * told me that he would have to stand by his predecessor 's decision ( something i can quite sympathize with ) is what prompted not just me but a number of distinguished members of the linguistic society to resort to the idea of an open letter . far from wishing to be divisive , i ( and others ) have tried since 1990 to address what we perceived to be a major omission , and to address it without public fanfare . however , this has had no effect . i report this with all due respect to the achievements of * language * under sally 's editorship , respect which i am sure is widely shared . it seems to me that a request that she change an editorial decision can in no way harm that distinguished record . alexis manaster ramer p . s . since the original posting , the following people have asked to have their names added to the signatories of the letter : edith moravcsik sebastian shaumyan david stampe daniel radzinski lloyd b . anderson - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - moderators ' message : we are taking the unaccustomed step of commenting on a discussion , because it 's christmas and we would love to encourage peace on ( the linguistic ) earth if we could . with regard to a review of illich - svitych 's work , all parties agree that : a ) * language * commissioned a review in 1991 b ) the original review is now unlikely to come in to us , these facts suggest both that ( a ) * language * acted fairly in soliciting discussion of nostratic and ( b ) the signers of the open letter acted in good faith in requesting another review . the linguistic issue here is the merit ( or non-merit ) of the book . if subscribers would like to address this issue after the break , we ' ll be happy to post such messages . otherwise , this discussion is closed . peace ! helen & anthony postscript : since it 's difficult to discuss a book no one has read , we would like to remind you that the book was announced on linguist as "" available for discussion .

sum : analogy to 1sg,"some time ago i posted query asking for an an example of an analogical development in the inflectional system of any language , preferably an indo - european language , whereby the 2d and 3d persons singular were remade in the image of the 1st sg . the very possibility of such a development appears to have been denied in an important article by cowgill on the reflexes of ie laryngeals in greek , and it struck me as a bizarre claim , but i could not found any ready counterexamples . i would like to thank robert hoberman , lars borin , dana paramskas , george fowler , maggie winters , and max wheeler for responding . the closest to what i am looking for was identified by wayles browne : polish present tenses of the verb ' to eat ' : jem 1sg jesz 2sg je 3sg of these , only jem is inherited . the other two forms have been remade analogically , replacing what would be expected to come out as * jesi , * jes ' c ' . however , even this example is not completely compelling since it seems that the analogy here involves this verb taking the endings typical of another conjugation rather than specifically remodeling the 2sg and 3sg on the basis of the 1sg . so , was cowgill right ? can 1sg never serve as the basis for an analogical remaking of 2sg and 3sg ? ( there are examples of 2sg being ( re ) modeled on 1sg , robert hoberman pointing out that this is what happened in the perfect of ge ' ez , and i have since also found discussion of this happening in some yemeni arabic dialects , but the 3sg is not affected in any of these cases ) . alexis manaster ramer

query : writing and phonology,"are there many languages with contrastive vowel length which dont represent vowel length in the writing system ? this does happen when someone with a poor understanding of the language devises a writing system for it from outside , or when a vowel length language adopts a writing system from a non-vowel - length language , but i would be interested to hear of cases of indigenous writing systems that ignore such an important aspect of phonology . the reason for my interest is korean . it is often said to have contrastive vowel length , at least in certain word-pairs , and yet it does not show it in the script . the fact it doesnt - coupled with the fact that native speakers have difficulty picking which word has the long vowel - seems to me like an argument for treating the distinction as one of accent or stress rather than vowel length . but the argument depends on how common it is for writing systems to ignore vowel length . what do people think ? reply to me and i ' ll make a summary of responses if there are several . thanks helen _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hfraser @ metz . une . edu . au ( 129 . 180 . 4 . 1 ) helen fraser ( dr ) dept of linguistics university of new england armidale nsw 2351 australia phone 067 73 2128 / 3189 fax 067 73 3735

query : preserving field recordings,"i have a question about preserving regular * analog * recordings made in the field . i work in rural chinese , and for the most part i collect inventories of lexicon , along with some texts . for ordinary background recording of interviews i have been using a $ 45 panasonic microcassette recorder on half-speed , which does * quite * serviceably even without an external mic . i intend to use ordinary high-bias non-metal cassettes for material i want to work with in some detail , such as stories , conversations , and recitation . i can transfer that to micro-cassette for transcription , so that the master remains in good condition . what concerns me is finding a way to preserve material originally made on analog tape . tapes mildew rapidly in taiwan and southern china , and even in seattle and new york i have had tapes become unplayable after a number of years in storage . i was thinking that if there were some inexpensive and painless way to digitize ordinary analog tapes , i could transfer them to cd here at my school , for only the price of the cd itself ( about $ 12 ) . one problem is wasted space : i can only fit 74 minutes of uncompressed sound on a cd , because one seems to have no choice but to record in stereo , even if the original source is mono . does anyone have any experience with this ? i could get far more material onto a cd if i compressed it but i do n't want to do that , because i have no confidence that today 's compression protocols will be readable in 20 or 50 years - remember the data from the 1960 us census , which was stored on magnetic tape and could no longer be read by the mid - 1980 's ? if something is important enough to preserve on cd , i do n't want it to become unreadable in a few decades . i 'd appreciate hearing any ideas on long-term storage . also , if anyone has ideas about why digital equipment might still be preferable for my work , i 'd like to hear them . i will summarize the responses i get . sincerely , david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 usa < charmii @ u . washington . edu > web : http : / / weber . u . washington . edu / ~ yuenren / circular . html

could of,"i have been following the recent discussion of ` would of ' with interest , as i am writing my dissertation on the grammaticalization of ` wouldve ' / ` couldve ' / ` shouldve ' ( i . e . modal + ` have ' + pastparticiple constructions ) . [ for those unfamiliar with the term , grammaticalization is , approximately , a type of gradual reanalysis that turns material that used to be more independent and lexical into material that is more dependent and grammatical . ] i ' ve noticed that the discussion has focused on pronunciation and spelling as indicators of "" native speaker intuitions . "" another approach is to look at syntax . many speakers consider what wouldve you done ? pretty close to acceptable ( though of course many other speakers completely reject this ) . then there are also sentences like ( both heard on npr in the past week ) they never asked the right questions when they shouldve have . ( orangecounty ) or if this incident had occurred a year ago , i wouldve had been more concerned about it . ( helicopter in n . korea ) for now i will make a couple of points of my own , and next time i will respond to some previous postings , esp . frits stuurman 's queries . 1 ) syntactic data like these can tell us what speakers feel belong together . is the / @ v / a verb ? a preposition ? this data does n't answer those questions , but does tell us that ` wouldve ' is being interpreted as a unit that behaves like an auxiliary verb . 2 ) intuition data can be supplemented with corpus data and experimental data . for instance , in pilot elicited imitation experiments where subjects try to repeat exactly what the stimulus tape says , i am finding that modal + adverb + have sequences are much more often repeated as modal + have + adv , than modal + have + adv sequences are repeated as modal + adverb + have . this is another way to show that ` have ' ( often pronounced / @ v / or / @ / ) is , for some speakers , dependent on the modal . as for corpus research , i have diachronic data suggesting a historical trend in this direction . i am also working on comparing synchronic spoken vs . written data . 3 ) as part of my dissertation , i ' ve been planning to get "" expansions "" of contracted forms , like what tom cravens described , and i am getting subjects from age 4 on up to as old as i can find . so hopefully in a few months i ' ll have some systematic data to answer some of the questions that people have raised . by the way : does anyone have a good name for this type of construction ? the best i ' ve been able to come up with so far is "" past counterfactual "" , but i 'd prefer a name with a more syntactic , less semantic , sense . joyce tang boyland ( jtang @ cogsci . berkeley . edu ) institute of cognitive studies , uc berkeley

comparative method,"these are notes after the recent discussions of karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after the aaa meetings sessions on distant language reconstructions , and also in response to part of mr . poser 's message of 14 december . first , most of the discussion of karl teeter i can agree with wholeheartedly except in the use of any of his criteria as absolutes . even grammatical things can be borrowed ( as sally pointed out ) . people do in practice * * * correctly * * * accept a language family such as uto - aztecan as essentially proven , even when no grammar has been written for the proto-language , or when only parts of a grammar are written . on the one hand , nobody would be disturbed much if it turned out that one of the assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally from another family , with truly massive borrowing from uto - aztecan . the overall hypothesis of a uto - aztecan family would not be shaken . on the other hand , asking the question how much of the grammar of the proto-language has to be written reveals the non-absoluteness of the criterion . only a tiny bit ? that might be subject to one of the special cases in which some morphology and other grammar were borrowed ( sally 's general type of example ) . so , again , karl is right in general , but wrong if any single criterion is taken as an absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined by feats of legalese into a single criterion ) . i would like to modify amramer 's statement in exactly the same spirit : ) we cannot demand a detailed morphological reconstruction ) until the languages are accepted as related . this is too strong . it is not quite the same as ramer 's ) but surely he does not mean that a comparative grammar is a ) prerequisite to a reconstruction ; it is part of a reconstruction . in practice , an extensive comparative grammar is indeed written as part of a reconstruction ( ramer 's second wording above , not his first above ) , but it is not likely to be written unless * * * both * * * of the following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) the languages are in fact related ( makes the grammar easier to write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe that the languages might be related and so put effort into establishing their links . it is some unwarranted discouragement of the second which needs to be dealt with in our field . ramer is right that some linguists do discourage attempts to prove what has not already been proven . no risk-taking , in other words . good researchers , attempting to write a grammar of altaic for example , will report all of their results , both for genetic relatedness , for borrowing , and for a host of other questions they will not even have thought of when they started their research . some researchers evaluate only the hypothesis they started with . very often the differences of viewpoint amount to nothing more than an elevation of what one does oneself into the "" true "" or "" real "" work of the field , instead of recognizing that it takes a number of different contributions . i will illustrate from karl teeter 's recent messages , with no malice intended , because i am absolutely sure he intends none himself . in modifying his wording to take account of amramer 's point that of course people do properly classify languages on the basis of phonological correspondences , teeter writes on 10 december : "" since it is clear that everybody 's first approximation to linguistic history begins with such classification . what i say is just that you cannot reconstruct languages on this basis . "" ( please note the words "" first approximation "" in this . that you cannot reconstruct languages on the bases of classification alone seems to me a tautology . ) later in the same message , teeter reverts to the more absolute statement : "" on the contrary , my contention ( not my invention ) , is that the only way to establish that languages are related is to write a grammar of the proto - langauge and show how it developed into different later grammars . "" ( please note the words "" the only way "" and "" establish "" . using these words does not change the fact that uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted as a proven family without teeter 's criteria being satisfied . ) on 8 december , teeter wrote : ) "" systematic correspondences of sounds in the vocabularies "" may prove ) a connection between languages , which is certainly an interesting ) first step , but there the real work of comparative grammar starts : [ then teeter mentions four possible explanations , only one genetic ] ) until one can exclude the first three factors , one has proven ) nothing at all regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts the enormous work of discovering likely language families in the first place , trivializes that as not the "" real work "" and establishment of systematic sound correspondences as proving "" nothing at all "" regarding genetic relationship . on the contrary , that does prove a grouping as a legitimate candidate for genetic relationship , and often the nature of the sound correspondences found will also have made one or more of the alternatives less probable . the work of comparative-historical grammarians is "" real work "" . so is the work of those who spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates to discover potential sound correspondences . do teeter and others really have no knowledge of how much work that takes ? at no stage is something ever completely proven in an absolute sense ( not even after a comparative grammar is written , because of the potential for undiscovered problems of the kind noted by sally thomas ) . all stages of the process contribute to the end result . all stages are equally "" the real work "" . proof is always incremental , not nothing , not complete and absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i turn next to mr . poser 's message , and to other information gleaned at the aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser will be surprised that i am enthusiastically in favor of anyone correcting any errors in any claims of language relationship or language structure , including mr . poser 's mention of kimball correcting errors in muskogean , even or especially if that means that a greenberg claim about pronouns in amerind is weakened . it is actually claims about morphology where i expect greenberg is least likely to have succeeded in contributing something . i thank mr . poser for the bibliography i can check against my lists of corrections and for this note on muskogean pronouns . i also agree with mr . poser that the criticism of errors in data does not rely on the mere authority of the critic . ( that was not my point about appeals to authority , so one of mr . poser 's paragraphs was not directly relevant . my earlier point about appeals to authority remains . ) i did not indicate ( as mr . poser 's message suggests ) that critics complained of errors when they could not back them up . what i did say was that they claimed greenberg 's errors made the method worthless , without bothering to test whether correction of the errors would actually lead to a change in his conclusions , and without promptly providing the data so others could carry out such a test . ) from conversations , i would judge some are still reluctant to face this test , the one required by a part of their claims . ( even if their claims on this point prove wrong in some degree , because the conclusions of greenberg 's method mostly remain the same even after errors of those kinds are corrected , it still will not follow that greenberg 's methods produce valid results on a regular basis . please notice how careful it is important to be with notions of proof for or against anything . ) in conversation with bob rankin at the recent aaa meetings i indicated i was glad greenberg had made the attempt at morphology , with his 3rd - person alternation between / y / and / t / as a putative relic irregularity , but i was equally likely to end up believing that he had discovered a new typological fact , a preference for these unmarked segments and recurring conditions under which they might alternate in more or less the same way , which might indicate that the same phenomenon could arise by chance repeatedly . we are always dealing simultaneously with possibilities of genetic relationship or convergent evolution . as a general warning about the danger of throwing out hypotheses too early because they are "" obviously "" cases of chance lookalikes or convergent evolution , an article "" common pathways of illumination "" by stephen jay gould of harvard , in natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses the origins of eyes in different phyla of the animal kingdom . he states that this had been a classic case in biology , used to show convergent evolution of originally unrelated organs to serve the same function . however , the dna specialists have gotten their hands on this one , and apparently it is * * * the same dna * * * which is regulating important parts of the production of eyes in these various phyla , barring of course a few changes in a few amino acid codes . this dna is therefore genetically inherited ( and we are talking as far back as the common node on the family tree of drosophila fruit flies , squids , and humans ! ) . if this line of argument holds up , we have quite a revolution in thinking on our hands . ( such thinking can of course go far overboard too . ) "" chance lookalikes "" certainly do exist massively . sound symbolism is a typological basis for their recurrence . the too-easy use of "" chance lookalikes "" to reject comparisons can however also be just like the too-easy use of "" substrate "" and many other ways of purporting to explain phenomena , but in reality merely naming them without doing the hard work of really explaining them . as another factual contribution to the discussion of greenberg 's errors , bob rankin clarified for me at the aaa meetings that he had looked at greenberg 's original notebooks , and that apparently what happened is that greenberg had a single flexible flap in his notebook bearing the language names , and sheets which he matched up against that to enter data for particular lexical items . this is a mechanism subject to errors of the two pieces of paper slipping vertically relative to each other , and in fact there were rather a large number of such errors . it was errors of rows rather than of columns ( as i loosely had assumed without ever bothering to ask if rows or columns ) . mr . poser originally asked on 9th november whether "" limitations [ of the comparative method ] had been and were being used to justify resistance to proposals of emote relationships . . . "" please take careful note of this wording , as mr . poser changed the wording in his message of 14 december , when he asserts no example has been given . i gave mr . poser an eyewitness account satisfying the wording he used . i stand by that eyewitness account . ( i do not like naming names ever in these matters , but mr . poser 's assertion could be answered only by an eyewitness account . ) none of mr . poser 's supposed rebuttal in his recent message is at all relevant to that claim , though it is relevant to another claim , an absurd one , that i did not make . ( as in his previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings of what are quite radically different hypotheses . any extended discussion of these variants would not be relevant to any of our central points , so i omit them . ) to be specific about that absurd claim i did * not * make , i quite agree with mr . poser that some of the same people also criticize greenberg 's hypotheses based on the factual data . i have never denied that , and in fact took pains to refer to other good work by the same people , and have always emphasized the importance of having corrections of data . mr . poser 's conclusion was : ) it thus appears , as i thought , that there are no real examples of perceived ) limitations of the comparative method being used as the basis for rejecting ) proposals of genetic affiliation . since i gave an eyewitness account of such an example of the perceived limitations being used as one basis for rejecting proposals of genetic affiliation , mr . poser can only maintain his original assertion by converting it into a different assertion as he has here , namely that there is no case of a person using those perceived limitations as "" the "" ( read "" the only "" ) basis for rejecting such proposals . i will simply repeat that in the case to which i was eyewitness , the tone of the presentation was quite clear that the absurdity of the time depth was sufficient * * * in and of itself * * * to rule out the legitimacy of attempting such distant comparison . ( a critique of errors in greenberg 's data is not directly relevant to this point , even if engaged in by the same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants his allies to be persons who not only do good work , but also do nothing wrong . but we cannot posit such a division between the "" holy "" and the "" unclean "" , like the caste distinctions of traditional india . no one has the right to take such a position vis a vis other good-faith researchers , however much they may disagree with data , results , or methods . i gather from some conversations at the aaa that some of the people involved have become more moderate since the earlier years in these matters , at least in their public statements . that is certainly all to the good . there are also small beginnings of developments of method which may turn out to be relevant to our current limitations . i am perplexed by mr . poser 's discussion of the supposed rule of using only three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although i used siouxan - yuchi , because some amerindianists are considering this , the point does not depend in the slightest on whether one believes these two particular nodes are related or not . perhaps someone can propose another alternative ( i would suggest looking for one in tibeto - burman , where perhaps only one consonant , one vowel , and tone would be available , and yet the genetic relations are in some cases secure . ) i agree with mr . poser that it is better to have three consonants than two , and precisely because it helps to avoid chance resemblances . as i stated in the previous message . that means that the only difference between us is that mr . poser will consider treating the preferred method ( 3 consonants ) as the only permitted one : ) if ( probably contrary to fact ) , matches of three consonants are ) necessary to exclude chance , . . . i do not see why we should be ) unwilling , in that case , to conclude either that they are not ) related or that , if they are , the relationship is not demonstrable . the problem here is the notion that such a particular rule * could even conceivably * be "" necessary to exclude chance "" . no rule is necessary to exclude chance . a large number of procedures and methods can * * * help * * * to exclude chance . except in the most difficult cases of all , probably most single rules can be violated , and there will still be enough other ways of excluding chance that a good result can be achieved . it is this fossilization in the response to expansions of the methods available as part of "" the comparative method "" which is damaging to increasing the rigor as well as the power of our field . it is encouraging to see sessions on distant language relationships . i firmly believe some of these sessions would not be occurring nor would there be so much work on studying methods , if greenberg had not published that book . some of the growth of interdisciplinary cooperation and communication was also in the process of happening anyway , and greenberg just accidentally published at this time . ( i am not trying to credit him with causing all of this interest . ) i particularly liked john colarusso 's contribution to the eurasian session , because he outlined his views on why distant language comparisons are very difficult because of the progressive loss of data , yet he is not in the business of criticizing people who attempt these . he is in the business of himself contributing to a deepening of both linguistic and mythological comparisons as much as he can in areas which are still to a great extent uncharted . johanna nichols also provoked much thought with her methods , and ways of integrating more information on peripheries vs . centers of innovation and residue of repeated waves of innovation visible even at the peripheries , as a pattern to look for in projecting a homeland backwards in time . i am somewhat skeptical about very distant language comparisons which involve only identities of sound correspondence , precisely because it is so easy for this approach to select a very old but still relatively more recent layer of borrowings ( more recent than the node on the family tree we may be struggling to find a way to reach ) . as greenberg pointed out , an increase in the number of conditioning contexts over time , once it approaches the number of lexical items available for comparison , leads to the result that there are virtually no recurrences of exactly the same sound correspondences . please see a separate message on how we can sharpen our tools to deal with this , titled "" typology of historical change "" . this means that i start out somewhat skeptical about alan bomhard 's nostratic and similar comparisons , precisely because he uses only or preferentially sound correspondences of identity . but that may be my personal bias , and i may end up granting that such a strictness of sound correspondences can actually work over great time depths . i cannot presume to know . there was one session i did not attend but report here from the abstract , in which researchers reported results of mitochondrial dna studies of the various native american populations . as expected , eskimo and athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . the remainder of native american populations shared four varieties of mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , or perhaps in two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend and says that the authors in their presentation had come down on the side of two major subgroups . population genetics need not match language directly , but the data is still at least interesting and obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson

qs : laryngeal phonetics,"dear colleagues : i have a number of questions regarding laryngeal phonetics . 1 . i understand that english voiced stops are phonetically voiceless unaspirated in initial position . ( data are cited in kingston & diehl 1994 : 432-434 . [ kingston , john , and randy l . diehl , 1994 , phonetic knowledge , _ language _ 70 : 3 . 419-454 . ] ) what is the story about pretonic intervocalic allophones after unstressed , short vowels , e . g . fidelity , legality , mobility ? to my ear they sound the same as in delegate , gallon , billion , but to my english - prejudiced ear they also sound voiced . 2 . what is the story about laryngealization or creaky voice ? i have seen this described as "" a very slow vibration through only one end of the vocal cords "" ( crystal , _ dictionary of linguistics _ ( ? inexact citation ) ) . what are the arytenoid cartilages doing at the posterior end of the vocal folds ? how is it related to the closure for glottal stop and for glottalized consonants ? 3 . what is going on with the articulation of "" stage whispered "" speech ? in whisper , the arytenoids are rotated so as to adduct the posterior ends of the vocal folds at their anterior ends , but the posterior ends of the arytenoids are not themselves adducted by the interarytenoid muscles , leaving a restricted , triangular opening at which sibilant-like turbulence is generated in place of voice . introspecting , stage whisper seems to me to be like whisper only with some turbulence as air passes the closure of the main ( anterior ) portion of the vocal folds . there seems to be somewhat higher subglottal air pressure , like a "" shouted "" whisper , but it does not seem to be merely a question of forcing air past the closed vocal folds . there seem to be some additional differences of articulation to produce the turbulence over the vocal folds , as evidenced at least by increased tension in observable laryngeal and ( to some extent ) pharyngeal muscles . it also seems to me that some degree of pharyngealization is an incidental byproduct . 4 . how is this related to pharyngeal spirants , as exemplified by arabic ? 5 . kingston and diehl ( 1994 : 441 ) say that "" in languages such as english "" ( meaning , i take it , languages without contrastive voiced aspirates ) the phonological distinction [ + / - voice ] is signaled in part by aspiration initially , but not ( if i read them right ) intervocalically . more important , it is said , is the ratio of duration of consonants to duration of vowels , or perhaps the duration of v to vc syllable rimes ( ? ) . can someone say more about this ? these questions bear on characteristics of a language i am working on . in the near term for purposes of defining the issues and refining research strategy , specific information will be more helpful to me than pointers to the literature , because my access to research library resources is not easy ( actually , it 's rather difficult ) , but i will need the pointers too and must of course eventually follow them up . all help will be greatly appreciated . please respond to me and not to the list . if there is interest i will post a summary . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com

sum : a ( formerly ) productive morphological process ?,"about 3 weeks ago , i posted in linguist 6-954 a query regarding the status in current english of a compounding process , involving the use of a ` combining form ' ending in - o - , which had given us not only such ethnic / geograhical terms as ` anglo - saxon ' , ` afro - asiatic ' , and ` dano - norwegian ' but ` sociopolitical ' , ` socioeconomic ' , etc . i was prompted in this query by the recent replacement of the label ` afro - american ' by the fuller form ` african american ' and by the appearance in a new edition of a college textbook of the term ` european american ' to mean what i have long referred to as ` euro - american ' . the issue first came to my attention a few years ago through a column in the university of illinois newspaper , in which an undergraduate woman of african ancestry explicitly rejected the label ` black ' on the grounds that it is , technically , inaccurate ; the skins of the people in question are merely a darker shade of brown than those of europeans . having said this , she then went on to reject the label ` afro - american ' because she could n't find ` afro ' on a map . as a linguist , i naturally wondered if she was unaware of the general compounding process involved . then a few weeks ago at work i found that the authors of the above-mentioned textbook ( on sociology , if i remember correctly ) had meticulously replaced every instance of the label ` white ' in the previous edition with the expression ` european - american ' . i began wondering if i was seeing a trend . first of all , i would like to thank the following respondents : lynne cahill < lynneca @ cogs . susx . ac . uk > lee hartman < ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu > larry horn < lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu > james kirchner < jpkirchner @ aol . com > kevin lemoine < lemoine @ mail . utexas . edu > the general consensus seems to be that the ascendency of the full expression ` african - american ' can be dated to a speech by the rev . jesse jackson in the late 80 's . to quote lee hartman : ` i think the entire "" phenomenon "" can be attributed to a single individual , and with alittle research we could even determine the precise date when he made his announcement . this is a textbook case of "" pristine "" etymology ( where the historical events giving rise to a word are still alive in the memories of living witnesses ) . ` i ' m referring to an announcement made by jackson to the effect that he felt the term "" black "" had too many negative connotations , and that he wanted to institute a more dignified term for americans descended from africans . ` i think jackson said explicitly that he briefly considered the term "" afro - american "" , but he rejected it on the grounds that "" afro "" was too closely equated with a particular hair-style , and he did n't want a term that would suggest merely "" americans who wear afro hair-do 's "" . ' a second motivating consideration mentioned by some of my respondents was that the reduction of ` african ' to ` afro - ' involved in the formation of the older ` afro - american ' might be interpreted as deemphasis and might thus be irritating , if not offensive , to people who regard their african heritage as a matter of pride . this is quite plausible , although it is n't consistent throughout the general speech community : it is not the case that every english speaker , in every circumstance , regards the formation of the - o - combining form from some word for the purpose of coining a compound involves the deemphasis of that word or its referent . for instance , in regarding myself as a ` euro - american ' i definitely emphasize the ` euro - ' part . and another of my respondents pointed out progovac ' recent rejection of the label ` serbo - croatian ' in favour of ` serbian / croatian ' on the grounds that the older / more traditional / conven - tional label places too * much * emphasis on the serbian component . on a somewhat parallel note , one of my respondents suggested that the form ` euro - ' might be rejected because , at least to an american , its most obvious association is with the expression ` eurotrash ' , which i have to admit is not part of my experience ; i am more accustomed to its usage in europe , in which it tends to connote ` cosmopolitan ' or at least ` pan - european ' as opposed to narrowly nationalistic . on the broader question addressed by my query , there appears to be no evidence that the morphological process of creating combining forms in - o - is itself on the way out in english ; only one or two instantiations of it are currently being rejected by some people for sociopolitical reasons . as to the past history of this process in english ( it 's presumably either borrowed from or heavily encouraged by greek ) , i have so far heard very little . best , steven - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *

sum : vowel length in orthographies,"a few weeks ago i posted a query about the orthographic marking of vowel length , with special reference to korean . i received many very interesting replies , both on korean and on the general question , which i will summarise below - the whole topic raises some issues that people might like to comment further on . first though - thanks to everyone who took the trouble to send me information . it was my first linglist query and i ' m delighted with the way it works ! it would have taken me ages to assemble all these examples from library research . at first i was surprised to get a lot of replies suggesting as examples of languages that dont mark vowel length , english , german and so on . then i realised i should have been clearer in my original request . a . fox put the problem well with his question : ' your query about writing and vowel length is slightly odd , since it implies that in most languages with contrastive vowel-length the writing system represents it . but this depends on what you mean by ' representing ' vowel-length ; in the sense of having an explicit and consistent marker of length , such as a double letter , a diacritic or other length mark , this is not very common , at least in languages with which i am familiar . but length can be implicitly marked in a variety of ways , and therefore discoverable from the spelling for anyone ( such as the literate native speaker ) who knows the system . ' i 'd intended to include all of these things as ways of ' representing ' vowel length ; definitely not only cases where vowel length is represented as a feature in its own right by a macron , double symbol etc . so what i wanted was examples of languages with an extensive system of minimal pairs differentiated wholly or mainly by vowel length which have identical orthographic representations of the members of the pairs . this is the situation in korean , for quite a largish set of words of both one and two syllables . it 's definitely not the situation in english , german , canadian french , danish etc . i dont think its the situation in latin either , though i might be wrong , and would be glad of correction . here and in quite a few of the other languages that were suggested to me , vowel length is predictable from some other aspect of the word ( including its lexical identity ) so you dont actually get many or any minimal pairs differentiated only by length . right ? the same would appear to be the case for hausa ; and possibly for the other estonian vowel length contrast ? my estonian is a bit rusty , but would i be right in guessing that the full three way contrast is fairly limited ? however , several of the pacific languages that were mentioned to me do seem to fit the bill : tokelauan , samoan , maori , fijian and the ponapeic languages are all candidates for having what i would call a genuine length contrast ( although it seems that in maori at any rate the system of contrasts is quite limited ) , which is at least sometimes not shown in the orthography . so , it seems , does the australian language bardi , and its orthography doesnt show it . . the thing i found very interesting was the number of people who sent anecdotal evidence about how native speakers of these languages feel about marking vowel length . their writing systems are all of course relatively recent introductions based on the roman alphabet , and there are plenty of ways they could show vowel length . but they dont always use this potential it seems . apparently the speakers of ponapeic languages use length marking inconsistently , so do fijian speakers , maori speakers find it ' unnatural ' and dont like using it , tokelauan teachers have decided not to teach it , and in samoa use of a length marker is banned ! there seems to be something worth exploring here . the obvious hypothesis is that though the words are differentiated phonetically by length , this is not the distinction that is most salient to the native speakers . the next obvious hypothesis is that it is some kind of lexical distinction , similar to that of english ' good ' vs ' food ' , ' boot ' vs 's oot ' , ' look ' vs ' loop ' etc that is perfectly simple for native speakers and horrible for learners . ( which could also explain why gaelic has taken the opposite trend and started marking vowel length where it never used to , since it is used so much nowadays by less than fully native speakers . . . ) . thoughts on these hypotheses would be gratefully received . but back to korean . . . this still seems like a very unusual situation to me . it seems likely and indeed it was suggested by some of the korean respondents that the original hangul did have a length marker , but i have found no evidence for this in my research on hangul . ( that 's why i posted the orginal query , and i ve just had another look at ledyard 's thesis on the topic . ) maybe i just need to do more careful research : pointers on this also gratefully received . a couple of points of clarification : the distinction between the monosyllabic vowel length ' minimal pairs ' does seem to be dying out ( though it is the fact that it previously existed but was not marked in the writing system at that time that i find odd ; could it be that the lack of orthographic representation contributes to its demise ? ? ) . but there is a clear distinction in the sound of the two syllable pairs . to my ears these distinction seems to be much more one of pitch accent than of length . and : when i said that native speakers dont easily identify vowel length , i didnt mean that they say ' my language doesnt have a vowel length distinction ' - which would indeed be a statement to be cautious of ! i meant they dont know which word is supposed to have the long vowel and which the short . this is consistent with information sent by native speakers that it is something taught in schools as a prescriptive rule well for anyone who has read this far , let me reward you by sharing with you this response from fran karttunen ( i hope she doesnt mind ) . i dont know exactly how to interpret it with respect to my questions above , but i ' m sure there 's something in it for all of us ! ' both the maya and the nahua ( speakers of unrelated mesoamerican languages ) had achieved a partially-syllabic approach to writing before the arrival of europeans in the first quarter of the 16th century . from what we can tell of their writing , both made some use of rhebus principles in which a drawing of thing , the name of which was similar rather than identical , was used to suggest the intended word / syllable . for instance , a drawing of a a bare bottom ( tzin-tli "" buttocks "" ) was used for the honorific suffix - tzin . likewise a drawing of a banner , pan-tli was used for locative - pan . these two examples are suffixes , but there are similar cases for initial syllables of nahuatl noun stems , for instance . vowel length , at least for nahuatl , is not taken into account in these cases . the honorific suffix today has the reflex of a long vowel in most modern dialects of nahuatl , making it homophonous with the stem of "" buttocks "" , but attestation from the sixteenth century consistently show them to contrast in vowel length ( short for the honorific , long for "" buttocks "" ) . same for "" banner "" ( long vowel ) versus the locative ( short ) .

ijcai95 workshop on context in nlp,"call for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today 's text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is "" context of the previous utterance / sentence "" "" context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far "" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in "" official "" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : - sort out as many as possible things before the workshop - help focusing the workshop discussion on the hardest and most controversial issues - raise objections and bring up controversial claims early on in order to prepare well thought of answers and constructive critique participants : a limited number , 30 or so , active participants will be selected on the basis of submitted papers . a small number , 5 or so , of no-paper -

are most people bilingual ? - - summary,"a few days ago i inquired about estimates of what portion of the world 's human population is bilingual . one motive i had in asking was to be able to "" shame "" my students into taking their language study seriously . "" be a mainstream human being ! "" , i would exhort them . i thank michael brody , eva fernandez , jussi karlgren , and ruth kearns for their informative replies ( insofar as there is information to be had on this topic ) . see reference list below . the authors point out that one problem with this question is the difficulty of defining "" bilingual "" , since most people so described are not equally proficient in both languages . some key excerpts follow : romaine ( 1995 : 8 ) : "" there are about thirty times as many languages as there are countries . this entails ( sic ) the presence of bilingualism in practically every country of the world . grosjean ( 1982 : vii ) estimates that about half the world 's population is bilingual . there are , however , no really precise figures on the number and distribution of speakers of two or more languages . "" grosjean ( 1982 : 2 ) : "" it is an interesting fact that no really precise statistics exist concerning the number and distribution of speakers of two or more languages . "" romaine ( 1995 : 9 ) quotes makey ( 1967 : 11 ) : "" bilingualism , far from being exceptional , is a problem ( sic ) which affects the majority of the world 's population . "" grosjean ( 1982 : 2 ) quotes lewis ( 1976 : 115 ) : "" bilingualism has been ( , ) and is ( , ) nearer to the normal situation than most people are willing to believe . "" end of quotations . you may remember that i asked if there were any _ principled _ estimates , and , so far as i can tell , the authors say little about the bases or reasoning behind their estimates . ruth kearns points out that "" estimates tend to come from the statistics on numbers of languages spoken in various countries and statisitics of population size in those countries . "" for me , it remains a wide-open question . jussi karlgren expressed an interesting hunch , "" . . . that the number of languages spoken has an inverse correlation with the average schooling of the general population in the area . "" rather than take this as a sarcastic commentary on the inefficacy of formal language teaching , i have taken the liberty of rationalizing it as follows : schooling tends to impose artificially a single standard language to the detriment of a plurality of languages spoken "" naturally "" . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = references grosjean , francois . 1982 . life with two languages . cambridge : harvard university press . lewis , e . g . 1976 . bilingualism and bilingual education : the ancient world to the renaissance . in bilingual education : an international sociological perspective , ed . j . fishman . rowley , mass . : newbury house . mackey , william francis . 1967 . bilingualism as a world problem / le bilinguisme , phenomene mondial . montreal : harvest house . mackey , w . f . 1976 . bilinguisme et contact des langues . paris : klinckseick . romaine , suzanne . 1995 ( 2nd ed . ) . bilingualism . oxford : blackwell . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = lee hartman ga5123 @ siucvmb . siu . edu department of foreign languages southern illinois university carbondale , il 62901-4521 u . s . a .

re : 5 . 1344 native speaker intuitions,"the discussion on native speaker intuitions has been extremely interesting , but i worry that my brief intervention may have muddied the waters . i take it that there are a number of separable issues . the first is the extent to which a native speaker is likely to judge a lexical string as grammatical or ungrammatical per se . the second is concerned with the relationships between syntax and interpretation ( although even here the distinction may not be entirely clear cut ) . most english speakers would probably judge child teacher the the asked leave to room the as both ungrammatical and uninterpretable . however , my couple of sentences ( which were from a source that i no longer recall - apologies ! ) raise slightly different issues . if it is possible to interpret the following : 1 . the child asked the teacher to leave the room 2 . the teacher asked the child to leave the room as having the same consequences ( i . e . that it was the child who left the room ) then it seems to me that the relationship between grammatical representation and interpretation is inherently unstable . just because some native speakers solve the problem in one way should not override the empirical fact that other native speakers solve it in another way . if we take the strings : 3 . i would ' ve done it . and the emphatice assertion : 4 . i really would have / of ( / ov / ) it would seem that , on the evidence of ( some ) british speakers ' phonologies , have = of . i . e . , they treat of as a verb in some circumstances . as prescriptivists , we can tell them that they are wrong , and explain ( by analogy ? ) why they are wrong . as descripivists , though , it seems that we have to take such native-speaker intuitions at their face value . in the latter case , we are left with a conundrum and one that seems to me particularly relevant to the problem of second language teaching : who is a native speaker ? for what it is worth , i have tried to explore these issues more detail in ' language and the linguists ' , _ social semiotics _ ( 1993 ) , 3 , 2 , 161-181 tony bex

sum : computer transcription,"a couple of months ago , i asked the members of this list for help regarding software for the transcription of spoken discourse . i received a large number of answers , some to my personal e-mail address , some ' public ' . in the following i shall quote some of the answers and attempt to sum up what i consider to be the most important info received on the matter : perhaps slightly off the subject a few answers spoke of the possibilities for machine-readable text : quote : ' a company named norris communication ( san diego , ca ) sells a digital recorder that breaks down audio input into machine readable code ( including ascii i assume ) ' ' norris is reputed to be only one of two companies in the usa ( maybe the world ) manufacturing digital audio recorders using so-called "" flash chips "" ( semiconductor memory chips that permit both read and write functions ) . the digitized flash memory can be "" dumped "" to a pc in machine readable code ( which i assume would include ascii compatibility - - that 's my assumption ) . i do n't have an address , but i got their telephone number from directory assistance . the company is located in a suburb of san diego , california called poway , california . the listed telephone number is 619-679 - 1504 . if that does n't work for some reason , directory assistance can be reached at 619-555 - 1212 . ' a number of answers centered around using standard word processors ' macro facilities : quote : ' i used to do this quite satisfactorily on the pc using ms word with glossary items to quickly input speaker identification , special character sequences , etc . use a style sheet for controlling formatting . i imagine that word perfect for the pc can do the same thing , especially with its macros . ' ' i ' ve made a set of macro 's which operate on a standardized form to facilitate the transcribing process . essentially what i did is simply reduce all routinely occurring series of keystrokes to one alt - or control - key . ' most transcription software seems to be available for the mac : quote : ' for the macintosh i would definitely use nisus with a macro that has been assigned a short and easy to type keyboard shortcut . from little things like this to far more complex tasks , nisus is amazing . it is truly the power user 's and linguist 's word processor of choice . from what i have seen , it is also the most worldscript - savvy word processor available . if you have n't seen it , check out the new nisuswriter 4 . 0 which should be shipping very soon if not already .

sum : walloon,"several weeks ago i posted a passage in the local walloon of the bastogne area of belgium and asked for a translation . i had quite a number of responses , and it appears that the responders had a good time wrestling with the passage . here is the passage : i - gn-e ` a po ^ pre ` s kinze ans du d ' ci , dj ' asto amon albe ^ rt le ` yona ^ rd e ` t dj ' rawa ^ rdo pace k ' on m ' avot dit k ' ou profe ` sseu ^ r do se ' mine ^ re vlot nos ve ` y po pa ^ rler do walon . dju m ' sovin co k ' dj ' e ^ dmande ' a c , ' momint la : < < kin - a ^ dje k ' il e ` , don c , ' cure ' la ? > > dj ' e ^ vite avou compris k ' i n ' astot nin pus cure ' k ' mi , surtout cand dj ' l ' e ^ ve ` you avou oune be ` le djon . ne bwe ^ ce ` le ki n ' compurdot we ^ re lu walon , me ^ s k ' astot bin de ` cide ' a l ' aprinde avou de ` s profe ` sseu ^ rs come pierrot , come jeannot , come roger , ou come mi , di-st - i l ' fou . and here is the consensus translation : il y a a ` peu pre ` s quinze ans d ' ici , j ' e ' tais chez < < albert le ' onard > > et j ' attendais parce qu ' on m ' avait dit qu ' un professeur du se ' minaire voulait nous voir pour parler du wallon . je me souviens ce que j ' ai demande ' a ` ce moment-la ` : < < quel a ^ ge a-t - il donc , ce cure ' - la ` ? > > j ' avais vite compris qu ' il n ' e ' tais pas plus cure ' que moi , surtout quand je l ' ai vu avec une belle jeune demoiselle qui ne comprenait gue ` re le wallon , mais qui e ' tait bien de ' cide ' e a ` l ' apprendre avec des professeurs comme pierrot , comme jeannot , comme roger , ou comme moi , dit-il , le fou . there were some uncertainties and disagreements ; i ' ve gone with the majority view in each case . the biggest problem was the very last bit , which caused havoc , though the gist of it seems generally clear . there was some disagreement as to whether it was the non-priest or the young girl who wanted to learn walloon ; most people went for the woman , which is what the syntax appears to say . the strange form < rawa ^ rdo > in the second line appears to be the same word as french < regarder > , but i am told that , in northern dialects , this word is widely used in the sense of ` wait , wait for , watch for ' . another headache was the word < bwe ^ ce ` le > in line 6 . this clearly means something like < demoiselle > , and it is possibly the same word as french < pucelle > ` virgin , maiden ' , which is unlikely to be the sense intended . i am told that speakers of walloon are now generally elderly , apart from some younger people who are enthusiasts ( though the belgian student i consulted here told me she had a friend who spoke walloon ) . some younger people of limited education are also said to have a grasp of the variety , and , engagingly , i am told that obscenities and insults tend to persist especially well . one respondent objected to my speaking of walloon as a dialect of french , preferring to see it as a distinct language . here 's an english version : it 's fifteen years ago now ; i was at the "" albert leonard "" [ institute ] and i was curious because i had been told that a teacher from the seminary wanted to see us to talk about walloon . i still remember what i was wondering at that moment : "" so how old is that priest ? "" i quickly understood that he was no more a priest than i was , particularly when i saw him with a beautiful young girl who scarcely knew any walloon but who was determined to learn it from teachers like pierrot , like jannot , like roger , or like me ; that 's what he said , the fool . the passage was written by m . georges pasau , pre 's ident du muse ' e de la parole au pays de bastogne ; it appeared in issue 4 ( 1994 ) of the magazine _ singuliers _ , which is devoted to walloon . this was a special number given over to the publication of a new dictionary of walloon . the dictionary is michel francard ( 1994 ) , _ dictionnaire des parlers wallons du pays de bastogne _ , brussels : deboeck / universite ' , isbn 2-8041 - 1957 - 2 . francard is professor of romance linguistics at the university of louvain in belgium ; his address is faculte ' des lettres , universite ' catholique de louvain , louvain - le - nauve , belgium , and his e-mail is francard @ frwa . ucl . ac . be . i have n't consulted him yet , but plan to do so . the orthography used here for walloon was , i believe , invented by francard specifically for the dictionary . the dictionary contains some nice dialect maps and some linguistic information about walloon . my thanks to jean - francois carrasco , richard coates , jean - francois delannoy , roger feron , frederik fouvry , vincent granville , ted harding , yolande meessen , philippe mennecier , bernd moebius ( and his mother ! ) , joseph reisdoerfer , thierry j . van steenberghe , guido vanden wyngaerd , and max wheeler . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

uk linguists : invitation,"i am forwarding the following message on behalf of the people who are responsible for inspecting teaching in all our linguistics departments . please circulate to colleagues who do n't subscribe to linguist . xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx "" 18 november 1994 1995-96 higher education quality assessment programme as you may be aware , the higher education funding council for england ( hefce ) is required under the terms of the further and higher education act 1992 to secure that provision is made for assessing the quality of education in institutions for whose activities they provide financial support . the council has welcomed this obligation and sees assessment of education as a vitally important part of its work . assessments are carried out within specific subject areas and assessors , who are experts in their fields , visit institutions to judge the quality of the student learning experience that they observe . one of the eight subjects to be covered in the 1995-96 programme is linguistics . other subjects which are included and which could be linked in assessment with linguistics are german & related languages , french , russian & eastern european languages , italian , and iberian . the subject specialist assessors must have industrial , commercial or professional experience in their subject , coupled with a broad knowledge of higher education : it is unlikely that anyone at a junior level will have sufficient authority . the minimum commitment will be to take part in four assessments visits between april 1995 and september 1996 ( a total commitment of 20 days of which just 14 will require an absence from the workplace ) . each specialist assessor will be paid a per diem rate of l150 including vat , and travel and subsistence costs will be met by the council . full training will , of course , be received by assessors aimed at developing their assessment skills . this focuses particular attention on role and use of self-assessments , and on the conduct of assessment activities , including the protocol to be observed when carrying out assessment visits . further particulars on the role of subject specialist assessors can be found in circular 33 / 94 which has been sent to all he institutions in england , scotland and northern ireland . if any members of your association would be interested in becoming assessors , or even simply in finding out more about the role of an assessor without committing themselves , there is an informal meeting on 5 december in london and two others on 6 and 12 december in birmingham at which they would be most welcome . in which case , please contact shirley cook on 0272 317461 as soon as possible .

university of durham : chair in japanese,"you may know that there is now a generative linguistics department at the university of durham ( m davenport , j emonds , sj hannahs , bd schwartz m tallerman , m young - scholten + elt specialists ) . the japanese programme is now also expanding . however , the only present lecturer of japanese is w mcclure , formal semantics ( cornell phd - - and longtime organiser of tas in japanese there ) . mcclure is presently the basis of enlarging japanese in an east asian department , which before now has focused on chinese . now , a new japanese professorship is open . a curious characteristic of the university of durham is that searches for staff members are set up to last literally for days rather than weeks . as a loyal member of the linguistics department , no further comment on this strange fact of life . nonetheless , the administration is honestly determined to hire from the best candidates - - but of course , this means everything is done in no ( or dammed little ) time . thus , an absolutely top candidate is being searched for - - within two weeks . the closing date is 2 dec . the preferred area is history , literature , politics or social studies within japanese studies . however , a good solid sociolinguist , even one with a generative component , might compare very well with whatever other candidates this brief search unearths . that is , the very brevity of the search can favour a candidate not quite in the core area being sought . in fact , not ' can ' but ' will ' - - and has , and is the key to this message . lots of publications are the main thing . moreover , durham is also a bit short on top women staff . a sociolinguistic woman professor of japanese might sit quite well as a candidate . might be a nice sideways move to get around the glass ceiling in one 's own country - - a quick move up ( what the heck if the food is n't so great , it 's damp , there 's no good showers , etc . ) . look at that list of linguists above , and consider all the linguistic events , conferences , research grants , etc . that have recently involved durham . the people above are friendly too . post begins 1 oct . 1995 or as soon as possible thereafter . send a cv , as detailed as possible , with full career history and publications and any grants awarded , and a covering letter to : mr . jack boyd , director of personnel university of durham old shire hall durham dh1 3hp uk include the names , addresses , tel . and fax numbers of 3 referees , and indicate dates in jan . and feb . when you could not be present in durham for interview . only uk residents need to send 5 copies ; all others just one . there is also a special form ( 1 page ) which mr . boyd will send you ( or a linguist at this e-mail address will fax it to you if you send us a small note as to who you are ) .

comparative method,"in response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and "" a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world "" , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this "" because the cut-off point is so shallow "" , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet 's position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that 's how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .

usage - based models - symposium,"announcing the sixth biennial symposium of the rice university department of linguistics usage-based models of language rice university march 15-18 , 1995 invited speakers : mira ariel tel aviv university joan bybee university of new mexico john du bois university of california , santa barbara michael israel university of california , san diego sydney lamb rice university ronald langacker university of california , san diego tom givon university of oregon brian macwhinney carnegie - mellon university janet pierrehumbert northwestern university john sinclair university of birmingham ( u . k . ) arie verhagen university of utrecht description : the goal of this symposium is to explore approaches to linguistic theory that have in common the aim of accounting for linguistic usage . the empirical data for such theories is not restricted to linguistic intuitions about acceptibility , but comes from usage events of varied types . the focus is on the patterns found in the various sorts of usage data examined , and how those patterns can be extracted , represented , and used by the human mind . research from a variety of traditions will be represented , including corpus-based analyses , discourse studies , experimental studies of language processing and language acquisition , and instrumental phonetics . the approaches taken can be called data-driven , rather than model-driven , in that the fewest possible prior assumptions are made about what types of data are relevant , and that large sets of usage events are observed so that the detailed patterns found in actual usage can emerge . moreover , the various approaches taken show signs of converging toward a view of language as a dynamic system in which linguistic knowledge is not separate from its processing in language use . the linguistic models representing this view are usage-based by virtue of three factors : ( 1 ) the importance placed on usage data for theory construction ; ( 2 ) the direct incorporation of processing ( production and comprehension ) into linguistic theory ; and ( 3 ) the requirement that the models arrived at , whatever the direct source of evidence , must be testable with reference to language use . registration : no charge . symposium attendance on a space-available basis . for further information , contact suzanne kemmer ( kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu ) or michael barlow ( barlow @ ruf . rice . edu ) snailmail : dept . of linguistics , rice university , houston tx 77251-1892 .

"" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . "" dawn w . , evansville , in "" no free lunch "" "" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . "" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately !

"" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it would n't work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her "" hobby . "" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the "" rat race "" and it 's not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa order your reports today and get started on your road to financial freedom ! ! !
